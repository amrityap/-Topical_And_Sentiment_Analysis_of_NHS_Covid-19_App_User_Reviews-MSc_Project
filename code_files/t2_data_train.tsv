14	Beware! Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my wife's and my phones.	1

23	Because I have the iPhone 6 it is a little slow on getting updates right away. It says I am not allowed to get the app cause my phone doesn’t have the latest update. I really want the appppppp. So now I am sad cause I can’t get the app. Idk if you can change but if you can plz do.	1
24	It work for two days and then it stops by itself. Impossible to open again.	1
25	Excellent	0
26	As per title. It’s not a very smart decision to make to force us to turn on Bluetooth & leaving it on as it drains a lot of my battery especially if I have to leave the app running in the background. Even if we bring a power bank along with us, it will also get drained out. How many power banks do you expect us to bring along? 100?\n\nAs a developer, you can’t just think from your own point of view. You’ll also need to factor in things like user experience, usability, practicality & your app isn’t the only app we are using. I use my phone for work & I can’t afford for my phone to die on me just because your app drains my phone of battery. And these days, we’re trying to travel light, am I supposed to bring along 100 power banks along with me to ensure my phone battery doesn’t die on me when I’m outside? Please take into consideration that we may not be near a power source for us to plug in our phones 24/7 or be rich enough to buy 100 power banks or have enough space in our bags to carry all these power banks or even find it light enough to do so.\n\nLast but not least, if you guys want to force us into using something you guys created, at least please make it a pleasant experience & not make us hate or detest it even more. Wouldn’t it be better to make this app so fantastic & lovable that everyone WANTS to use it & not because we’re being forced to go through a torturous experience?\n\nThank you for reading through this valuable feedback & looking into the matter.	1
27	I already installed to trace together app. But still show not installed and can't go for work on my work permit. All my partanar already show green passed.What wrong me. Let me know.	1

30	Everything works well! We just don't have the reasons for going out, in the exemption certificate, in English anymore, which is... quite problematic. Hope the translation will be back soon!	0
31	As a developer I didn’t find any helpful feature in this app and also I can say that like this app there are so many Covid19 tracing open source app on GitHub any entry level developer can make this type of app within 24 hours. So I think that our government should choose more experienced developer teams who will be creating a unique product not like that open source editing product.	0

41	This app is ineffective. It doesn't meet its primary purpose. Uninstalled.	1
42	When you register for the app, the system will send you an OTP. The first OTP regardless if you typed in correctly or not will fail. Only on second OTP the registration will pass. Entering your birth and NRIC issue date, regardless of what year you typed in, it will default to "1970" after you accept it. It is only when you scroll to your birth year or NRIC issue year manually, then it will be correct. Do you guys check your work? This will cause massive data entry errors on your app.	1
43	Cannot install this app. althugh mobile has the required Android 6.0.0 and Bluetooth installed and switched on. After giving all the required details and retrieving the PIN for this app. and enter this into the app., this does not successfully install this app. into my mobile.	1

47	Very simple tool that requires lots of acesses Why gallery and call? Can you explain or maybe update and use different methods. Some says app uses new version of Bluetooth that will not consume battery, but that is not true \ud83d\ude05 Very good idea in general. Should be applied and explained better	1
48	Very satisfied	0
49	Cant open the app. It keep closing. Please fix i need to go and buy food, im starving.	1
50	This app is really helpful. It gives us the capability to easily get a comprehensive and precise report regarding covid19 around the globe. The scanning feature is also useful during this time of a pandemic.	0
51	Very easy to use. Signup worked without issues. Hoping enough sign up to make it a workable tracker!	0
52	When in proximity of another phone running the app it causes interference with BT audio devices, causing music or podcasts to pause repeatedly for 2 to 5 seconds. Makes it unusable and force stopping it while listening is the only way to stop the interference.	1

57	Has anyone else with a Samsung experienced problems with the app & their phone? Woke up this morning to a notification from the app about an update & then my phone, which is new, went from 100% to 38% & hasn't been the same since even though I've tried different things.	1
58	I can't download it!!!!!	1
59	Very useful.	0

63	I tried many times to register on this app , but it's always "ERROR" , I'm so sad and frustrated about this app , yes it's so helpful about the information of covid19 , but the problem is , it didn't work for registration , and I'm also Confused why it need also the gallery or the other private app included the terms of this apps, what's the connection ?	1
64	GOOD aplication	0
65	Best app in the world	0
66	Good idea but somehow it will not work if other people doesnt have phone/internet who cant install the app still we could not detect others if they're probable or positive ones.we are not even sure if people using this app is stating their real health condition and the app itself will just rely on people's health update, coz even positive individuals are asymptomatic.notifs cant be removed and its also draining the battery.	0
67	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
68	Not helpful	1
69	As far as using it is concerned, a good app. I didn't leave CH during this time so I never experienced unwanted "Turn bluetooth back on" messages. However... I tested positive more than 24 hours ago and have still not got any means of entering this into the app. Helpline cannot help either. Is this not the point of the app? Speed? How about having patients sign a form at the test center allowing the laboratory to enter the status locally? You don't need to be a Swiss engineer to implement this!	0
70	Great app. Hope it will lighten the contact tracer's job. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u2764	0
71	I have had to uninstall because it uses too much battery power. I will be uninstalling it on my husband phone too as he used to only need to charge his phone every 2-3 days prior to installing this app. But now he needs to charge it twice a day.	1
72	Crash/force close	1
73	In the last few days my battery has been drained by this app . This app is using over 73% of my battery. The phone is over heating as a result.	1
74	Worst app...ever. -should be Bluetooth ON -should be location ON -minimize battery life - privacy not safe.	1
75	Good	0
76	Not only is it a hassle to try to get this poor excuse of an app to work (i spent a good portion of an hour just trying to register as either the code didnt come or there was no blank to enter the code) it also links location settings to bluetooth so that when you turn on the location, bluetooth is also automatically turned on EVEN WHEN NOT USING THE APP! Im not even counting the fact that the app itself has a myriad of bugs but im already at the character limit.	1
77	Good 4	0
78	I was a bit wary using this app for the first time but they have a secure login system where you can use photo ID to grant the app access to you NHS medical records. Once connected it was super easy to order meds, keep everything up to date and view previous medical inputs on your file. Very very handy and I got my meds as swiftly as I would ordering on my Drs website. :)	0

81	Had this app for about a week.. Phone got almost red hot few days ago, battery died in 30 min after full charge...yesterday morning heard on a radio that this app does that...wiped phone after...now my battery charges only up to 68% . App destroyed my battery.	1

94	Proud to be a Bahraini ??	0
95	Two days in a row the app tells me I am in "higher risk" and says I've been in contact with 4 people. That is just not possible as I have not left my house thus certainly not been in contact (less than 2 meters for 15 minutes) with anyone infected. Please review the range check of the app.	1
96	I cannot make an account because it says that my IC number is invalid. It does not make sense,how can I IC number be invalid. Please fix your problem.	1
97	Very fast scans of QR code and love that you have added the Favourites section! Is it possible to allow users to rearrange the Favourite locations?	0

99	I can't get this to work. It keeps staying my phone number is invalid. I've tried with and without the leading zero. The app doesn't recognise either.	1
100	I am from Scotland and I deleted this app, the reason for this is when I installed app it says enter a mobile number, the number is foreign and its only 8 digits long, while UK starts +44 then 11 digit numbers, so since it doesn't work for Scotland or UK I ended up deleting it because can't even get by the first phase.	1

134	The app is working fine. Simple and professionally done! Congratulations! But I have a question about the algorithm.Can the app differentiate if someone carries his mobile on his/her body or if it it's located in a bag or the wardrobe box, far away from the user? E.g fitness center, swimming pool etc... I know several people who do not install SWISSCOVID because they are afraid getting false alarms	0
135	It completely destroyed other bluetooth connections (e.g., switch other bluetooth devices off). I deleted this app initially, but since I visit my clients often recently, I reinstalled it again to be a responsible person. I think it is a good idea to give us an option to switch off this app when we don't need to use it (e.g., sleeping).	1
136	The app is great and works fine, but for samsung user's it seems to have some issues such as the bluetooth connectivity is always turned on, notification sounds occurs every 2-3 min, some cases the screen is on until the app is forcefully stopped or till the screen lock button is pressed( screen timeout doesn't work). Hope so in the coming update all these bugs will be fixed.	1
137	Keeping me informed ???? thanks for letting me know	0
138	last update has ruined this app .. it doesn't work anymore	1
139	The app is simple, doesn’t get in my way, shows useful information about how to use it and importantly, doesn’t show any noticeable difference to battery usage.\n\nFor all those writing on Facebook, Twitter, etc about privacy concerns, you have much better privacy with this app than the social media platforms you’re writing your concerns on. Plus you have the ability to help limit the spread of COVID-19.	0
140	Why can't make the profile, i mean NRIC work permit i submitted my FIN number then it will be show invalid..... Any idea please!!!	1

149	I work in the epicenter of COVID-managing hospital, among confirmed cases with very close contact, and I didn't have a single notification to date. As long as this app depends on any individual downloading and reporting themselves, it's as useless as it could be.	1

174	***Experiencing Invalid Phone Number Issues?*** Turn off your wifi, and try again. This isn't mentioned in the app anywhere, but it should fix your problems.	1
175	Originally gave this a high review. Since then I have had a lot of issues with my phone maintaining connection with other Bluetooth devices. The worst instance was when it unpaired with my car which rendered my navigation and voice control unusable until I rebooted and re-paired it. Also suffering significant battery drain on a phone that can usually go 2 days without a recharge (galaxy a70). Also noticing shorter battery on my smart watch as it has to keep reconnecting to the phone as well.	1

194	The app is eating my batteries life. There been no notification on the app to say there was a problem. The information given on the App is pretty useless. The App could have been used to communicate information about ongoing corvid activities such as lockdown events, use of face covering, the daily figures issued by the HSE. The HSE are missing an opportunity to communicate relevant information to App users. The App is a good idea but could be utilised more.	1

276	Independent research has showed the government got the security right. My experience has been great with battery. No issues with it at all. And although we've beaten the curve for the moment, see this as insurance.	1
277	No issues	0
278	Found the issue why I'm unable to progress with the NRIC registration. The app is not backward compatible with existing users. I need to uninstall and reinstall before it works.	1
279	Please enable option to "Pause until I turn it on" or pause for X hours. Now I need to do a force stop through phone settings to close the app. With working from home as the norm, it can be days before I leave the house. Alternatively, allow users to setup a schedule to on and off. Or if the use of GPS is not a privacy issue, detect that the user has left a certain area and switch it on. Google maps now allows a user to specify home location.	1

310	I get why people would be unhappy about the app draining phone batteries. The idea is great... but its bypassing a lot of precautions and restrictions to stay awake and pull bluetooth information (polling), and agressive pinned notifications tend to be the most annoying type. Phone OS updates should help reduce wakelocks Other than that, it doesn't do much beyond tracking bluetooth IDs, like WiFi names, your phone/SIM network has your geo location, google/apple do too. Theyre beyond invasive.	1

313	Bad. Spotify becomes intermittent immediately when I download this app. The music keeps on skipping and pausing.

I have tried everything people/ 109 have suggested. I have rang 109 numerous times and they dont help. They logged a ticket 4 days ago and said the tech team will get back to me but I have heard nothing.	0
320	This app is bs, add mobile number says that it is invalid. How ridiculous and unhelpful in ever way. No point giving any rating when you can't pass step 2 because the design flaws. But to post this i have to give a star. Really it's worth 0 stars straight out honestly.	1

334	Bad experience, battery draining isn't the only problem with this app. Due to constant exchanges it causes all my bluetooth device to randomly disconnect frequently. Initially thought my devices were broken, but no, it's all due to this app. Have even tried different OS build + kernels but as long as I uninstall this app, the issue resolves itself. Won't be using this until the bluetooth disconnection issue is solved. Would not recommend others to use this unless no physical token.	1

E.g. a simple bar chart can make us aware of our social distancing effort and make improvement. 4. No option to allow us to turn off when at home.	1

463	Number invalid - turn off WiFi. Follows other's advice on forums and turned off WiFi and Bluetooth while putting in phone number and requesting PIN.

542	I was able to register fine but my phone keeps crushing if I actually keep the app going. At first I thought the phone broke but as soon as I switch the bluetooth off it works well again. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to having this app.	1

556	I actually did bother trying to read the privacy assessment, and it appears quite genuine. They allow a pseudonym, but you have the use a mobile phone number to activate it (rather than an anonymous email address), and so that's a bit pointless. But it should make contact tracing easier (which happens solely manually normally) so I support this effort.	1
557	No issues until today, massive battery drain - Samsung Note 8.	1
558	Hey Govtech Team, my app is stuck at the page where I have to enter my phone number to receive an OTP. Entered my phone number and clicked Get OTP and the loading button appears for a moment but nothing happens after that. Reinstalled the app and problem persists. Please fix.	1

580	This application is useful and very relevant during this time. The UI is good. However I experienced some crashing whenever I tried to input my passcode, tried to click on Start Scanning the app crashed. Next whenever I opened this system, it takes almost a minute to fully open. Lastly it will be really nice if you have tagalog translation of whole application. Let us all admit that some Filipino can't understand some english terms, make this "pang-masa" so that even ordinary pinoy will use it.	0
581	Remove this app.	0
582	Keeps cycling Bluetooth on off on off on off on off ad-infinitum which makes use of other devices IMPOSSIBLE.	1
583	Unfortunately I had to uninstall this app as it kept interfering with my bluetooth headphones and speaker. They both kept dropping out, every time I would use them. As soon as I uninstalled the app it stopped happening. Very disappointing as I think the app is a great idea (Galaxy S9+)	1
584	Why this app asking APIKey i cant register and also asking too much registration such a worst app	1

I leave my home once a week and don't want to have Bluetooth and location enabled the other six days, nor these annoying notifications... Update: Yesterday I got a notification about a potential infection. Very nice as the app seems to work, but I almost missed it because I'm very used to wiping away SwissCovid's notifications...	1

607	The Australia logo with the tick still appears in the status bar when Bluetooth is off, although the detailed text in the notification tray changes. Maybe a different icon to indicate that the app is not active would be easier to alert that the app needs to be checked?	1
608	worst app ever! hamper battery life!	1

610	I take the face pic but it seems it can't be sent becuase, after taking the picture the MOI demands from me to send the pic though I sent, so I call on the sent number of MOH but it does not response me.

621	Application not working	1
622	This is frustrating. The app just refuses to validate my particulars. I have no idea what's wrong with my name and nric. It just keeps saying validation fail.	1
623	My system UI crashed no less than 7 times just trying to get the app set up. And then I'm expected to trust that everyone actually has this app installed, and everyone is always carrying their phone on their bodies, and everyone always has their Bluetooth on, and everyone has immediately marked themselves as tested positive on this app (because apparently the qr doesn't work anyway)? Seems more than a bit farfetched to me. This app is only giving people a false sense of security in my opinion..	1
624	I can't register as the app constantly tells me my phone number is invalid, help!	1
625	The app is grand does what it says to a point. Doesn't need location permissions or contact permissions and uses Bluetooth instead but not sure how effective this could be. It is completely idiotic that people think they can base their rating on how easy the app is to find in the play store. It has nothing to do with the app itself! Rate the app based on the app and how it works not how it appears when searching.	0

632	Not opan this app in my mobile I need help way not opan?	1
633	EDIT: once I turned my VPN off, it was able to send the password and work. Still unhappy with it being a mandatory app however. Have tried multiple times over the past couple of weeks, always says error requesting OTP. Emailed customer service and their mailbox is full, no longer accepting emails. If an app is going to be mandatory and if we will be refused entry to stores without it activated, they need to fix it.	1
634	This is not a bad review for the sake of it, here are things to change 1. Share this app button, who uses that? Swap it out to either show the places you are checked in, or press it to access the favourites 2. Why do I need to activate the camera for scanning, then be able to press favourites, that should already be in the main menu, thus two \u53cd\u4eba\u7c7bdesign choices make this app more cumbersome to use than what It could have been	1
635	The app is eating my batteries life. There been no notification on the app to say there was a problem. The information given on the App is pretty useless. The App could have been used to communicate information about ongoing corvid activities such as lockdown events, use of face covering, the daily figures issued by the HSE. The HSE are missing an opportunity to communicate relevant information to App users. The App is a good idea but could be utilised more.	1
636	The arogya setu app has been detected as a malware by malwarebytes security software for android platform. I have download it from playstore and when scanned the device for malware. It detected arogya setu as a trojan malware. The particular line it says is Android.Trogan.Spy.Ahmyth.goi And says that it is a threat and has to be removed as soon as possible	1

I can't travel without this stupid EHS code. Phone numbers outside of Turkish numbers doesn't receive any SMS code. Totally disappointed in Turkey once again!	1

644	Good widgets and well thought shortcuts, but it keeps messing up my bluetooth connection with my airpods. everytime i get into a crowded space it makes my airpods go silent. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect it again. It’s a small issue but it can be slightly annoying at times.\n\nNever had this problem of airpods disconnecting before i installed tracetogether.\n\nPlease have an option to login other family members too. It’s annoying to have to open a whole different app because my grandma doesn't have a phone.	1

685	It was ok at first, but i noticed lots of connectivity issues and CovidSafe was the last app installed, after uninstalling the app, connection issues appear to be resolved.	0
686	Great app but could we also have a smartwatch version? Many smartwatches already have bluetooth enabled by default and it would be a waste to not make use of such technology for those who have smartwatches. Of course those who do not have smartwatches can use the phone version as well or the token.	1

703	Troublesome, and the person who give this idea to use this app should just die. Just use safe entry can already! Why need this app. Waste of government resources and people's money.

718	This app is not a user friendly. The app need also the internet connection and bluetooth simultaneously. Why not reprogram it where the user acct is still in log-in state even if it is not in used. Whereas the user will just need to on their bluetooth to scan the surrounding for possible covid-19 infected(pui, pum, positive) It doesn't detect any active users around the vicinity even if the bluetooth is on. You can also add a map feature of the area of the user where the 5m-305m are shown.	1

I didn't find this app as efficient as canvassed by the Government. After response from the developer, this app has restarted as usual on OTP based vfn. Again on 21Dec 2020, this app has banged in same like on 17 Sep 2020. I don't understand what is wrong.	1
783	Drained my battery and my phone overheated. I installed app when it came out. I had to uninstall, my phone still not right which I need for work so now have to get a new phone. Ridiculous that such an important app should be having an important impact has caused these issues. I would like to reinstall but will not be taking the risk on my new phone. Very disappointing.	1

789	Samsung note10+ user, overall pretty neat app but had to uninstall it coz it keeps interfering with my Bluetooth earphones (nural nt01) creating shuttering. Hope it gets fixed soon.	1

797	Unable to register with NRIC, shows validation error	1
798	This app works just like the government forcing you to switch on the bluetooth draining your battery when your mobile is already low bat. You will received a series prompt of death even when the app is turn off just so that they force your Bluetooth on. This is so much we can expect since they must have outsourced it to some team in India.	1
799	1. Bluetooth gets turn off automatically after opening the app. 2. When Bluetooth is working, one side of my wireless ear plug will not work.	1
800	The app doesn't even open....	1
801	Draining to the battery as app keep running in the background. Overall useless, just keep to the safe entry instead of a need to "trace" everyone.	1
802	The app helped me a lot during the curfew, i can ask for permits in real time \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb	0
803	My phone gets very hot when I am in public spaces. Likely due to this app scanning.	1
804	Please update your Pak neghayban service everyday. It was last updated on 08-06-2020 and today is 12-06-2020. If you can't update regularly why are you even putting this feature on your app. Even the radius data is also incorrect.	1
805	Turn off Wi-Fi while registering, this gets round invalid number issue	1
806	Still no update on announced (2 weeks ago) errors. :-(	1
807	So far visit visa or business visa holders doesn't have the access to this App in Qatar, a confusion in the public is those people are not allowed go out at all?	1
808	Very good	0
809	It doesnt show that anybody in our home is covid positive or not	1
810	Installation in English does not progress after checking screen to accept terms - no button to press - just hangs. Installation workd in Hebrew - then can switch to English.	1
811	The app drain my phone battery. There is no off bluetooth function on the app. I am using a smartwatch which is linked to my phone. If I off the phone bluetooth, I can't use my watch optimally. Please do your logistics proper before rolling your nonsense out. If you can't do a proper app then do not roll it out. If you can't have enough tokens, stop making Trace Together compulsory. Seriously dumb!	1
812	Assuming it's working it's a great app, you don't have to do anything. Just have it running. However some way to know its working would be nice. Even just a counter of how many other apps it's discovered in that day, just to know its doing something.	1

819	After recent update it is not opening	1
820	Battery drain	1
821	Application is not working properly. after splash screen when the app navigate towards main dashboard it automatically get close.	1
822	Please make it compulsory to use on public transport, public places, cafes, shops, etc. E.g. currently, people are using one common pen when leaving their details in cafes, etc. Not safe. Should be touchless like this app.	0
823	Good	0
824	Record contact within 2 mtrs? Jus at home without going out, there are aly recorded 13 contacted & the number keep increasing. Lol	1
825	Why you are so afraid of "rooted" devices? If this app is for everyone, then please remove "root" warning and allow to run. Cemen banget sih programmernya. Kalau aplikasi kayak gini doang gak mau jalan gegara Androidnya di Root, mending gausah ada aja.	1
826	In the last couple of days it has been hammering Google play services and draining my battery. It's not much use of your phone is dead. Please fix this bug	1

829	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
830	Renames your phone. Requies location permission for Android. To much permission. Uninstalling.	1
831	It tells me my phone number is not valid so won't send me a pin . Have tried with and without the 0 as the +61 was in the front.	1
832	It works well and easy to install. For Android - it run in background. For iPhone - need to open the apps at all time. Then it will show small icon on top left side of the phone.	0
833	Sorry, but this app is rubbish, each time I use the app it says please update. I try to update, then my phone says insufficient space, please remove other apps. When I finally get on to ordering my prescription, I then find that some of my drugs are missed off, so I have to write them in notes. Finally when my drugs are ready at the pharmacy, the drugs not officially listed are missing.	1
834	Nice	0
835	App has issues when locked and then nags you via notifications to open the app, too bad if you are using your device as a map/gps/watching a show on a commute etc.  The failings of this app are that they didn't adopt the framework made by Apple that would have allowed background and locked collection.  After a few weeks of nagging I uninstalled it, it's nagged me more times then what the state health service has used the data for all devices for.	1
836	App was fine when first released however have recently found it interferes with Fitbit linking when operating. Have to constantly disconnect app to allow other devices to sync. Not as convinced as once was that the app is worth persisting with. Waiting to see if next update addresses Bluetooth on iPhone otherwise will only turn on when I remember.	1

843	Don't exactly know if it works since I am not able to see my tracing data. Latest update gets too much personal data, why does this app need NRIC? Almost all apps have stored using nric. Also the recent update for safe entry needs more functionality to be fully effective, I am able to get my individual bar code to show a scanner at the mall, but am not able to qr scan for signs in parks, etc.	1

875	Im impressed by their idea, good app everyone had to have it	0
876	Now This app not opening	1
877	No GPS request, good.	1
878	Have installed the app but it's not very useful in protecting me as it requires me to have Bluetooth on all the time which is a huge battery drainer and only works if everyone also has their Bluetooth on. Good luck with that. Hence it doesn't achieve the goal of the app. Also, alerts don't work as you expect them to. Alerting me a couple of days later that I may have come in n contact with an infected person doesn't help me	1

I didn't change my phone number! I have also emailed the contact address provided, but no response. Not sure anymore if there is any point of keeping this as now my data may be on someone else's number?	1

896	super easy setup process, after which it's pretty much "set it and forget it". No excessive permissions required. Doesn't seem to affect my battery life much.	0
897	Radius Alert feature needs to be reviewed. e.g. as of 20-5-20 DC islamabad has reported that there are 34 confirmed cases in Islamabad G-9 Sector. However the App is showing none. In Lahore it does not show a single pin even at Expo Center that has been converted into corona hospital. Without credible stats and cases' exact location info the app loses its purpose and shows disconnect between app owners and concerned authorities collecting field data. With functional feature i would've given 5*	1
898	This is good but	0
899	Good keeps you up to date daily	0
900	According to the notification log, it last checked 5 days ago! If I'd got it, how many people might I have infected in 5 days! Is this app as pointless as it seems?	1

No thanks i prefer Magen 1 App deleted as is not suited for older phones and it kills the phone Talk to me on magen 3 i am very sory i was convinced to remove Magen 1	1
912	Good app.	0
913	Haven't had any issues. No noticeable battery drain. The new notification icon is much better	0
914	The application would close on its own. I once tried to keep this app open and not switch to anything else and once my mobile go into standby mode, it's closed and I have to relaunch again. Edit: Thx 4 reply. Oppo user > Battery >Energy Saver> Trace> Disable Background Freeze, Abnormal Apps Optimisation, Doze. Hope this helps and maybe update the app for the front page so users will instantly know what to look for in their mobile? I didn't know until I start digging around my settings.	1

975	So the app didn't allow me to book a test for 10 days after arrival.. went to exhibition centre and was advised to call 444.. called 444 and they said they cannot book the test either.. then a doctor calls me to confirm I do not have symptoms and says that I do not need to do a test.. so I ask for a refund and they say the 2nd test was free..?! So I had to pay for the test in advance but they cannot book an appointment so I paid for nothing? Don't travel to Bahrain unless u want to donate 30bd!!	1

1005	Simple app, easy to activate and could save lives. Those worried about privacy might consider all the other myriads of data their smartphone sends out without their knowledge. You effectively forfeited your privacy when you bought the phone! Here you have the chance to save lives and the data has very strict access restrictions, so unless you have something to hide then do yourself (and others) a favour and download the app.	0

1080	Can you make the Bluetooth not compulsory? I just want to use this for safe entry check in and out	1
1081	App works fine, but number 1 rule is to not rely on the user to input data. This needs to be adjusted to use the Apple / google API specifically created for privacy focused contact tracking.	1

1108	Uninstalled! When I installed the App I started to get audio glitches and freezes when using my Bluetooth headphones. Updated all music Apps, cleared App caches, reset and updated headphones but still getting glitches a couple of times each song. Very annoying. Uninstalled the App and now everything is working perfectly! The Contact Tracing element of the App is obviously interfering with the Bluetooth signal to the headphones when it searches for nearby devices. When a fix for this is announced I will try the App again, until then my music takes priority. Phone:- Huawei P30 Lite, Headphones:- Sony WH-CH700N	1

Don't know what to do.. I left trying..	1
1113	Wasting my phone battery...useless App.	1
1114	Good job	0
1115	I never got any alerts from this application even though I had covid affected neighbours. The worst thing is that I got COVID-19 infection and the application shows that Im safe. I guess this application is just for data collection and there is no other motive of this application.	1

1126	They're lying about the download numbers. The app also asks for access to gps, despite the government stating specifically that the app would not require this and that tracking information would not be required or stored. Blatant lies absolutely incredible.	1

1147	Thanks a lot. This is indeed a very good platform to find the updated and reliable infirmation. Would also appreciate if myth busters are also included so that citizens and residents can use this platform as a single point for clarification and referring false or fake newz.	0

1158	Not working	1
1159	Wow	0
1160	Drains battery, phone dies within 3 hours of unplugged but can see its benefits	1
1161	people who hate the government are saying this is a good idea, you have an independent code review who decompiled the app and said it is safe, and you have a chance to make your life, and those around you safer, you have to put aside your fears. If ur worried about data loss, do some research about what the app does. It captures contact with someone else's Bluetooth signal and logs it. Location perms only because in Android, access to Bluetooth is tied into the same permission as location req.	0
1162	Phone overheating, battery gone from 100% to 0 in less than 3 hours. Worked perfectly well beforehand.	1
1163	Well-done	0
1164	I like the qr scanner. It is very fast and accurate. And also the check out/ check in icon that helped me to remember to check out before checking in. But why is it that i cannot download the latest version, 2.4 that allows multiple check in?	1
1165	Make an update for locked areas. Radius alert still required update because in my area there are 200+ cases but according to this app i am in safe zone. How's that possible?	1
1166	Good app, it’s very convenient.	0
1167	Best app	0
1168	Worst app ..... This app violates our privacy...	1
1169	Good idea. Pity it's not up to date on current cases and it certainly would be better if locations and clusters were shown . That's why it's only 1 star.	0
1170	When I keyed in my NRIC, it couldnt register it.i waited for the next day to try again, and the same thing happened. It's rather frustrating	1
1171	The app has been great, and I'm glad to have it, but since Friday 10th August it has been draining battery life, so I have had to knock the Bluetooth off.	1
1172	Drop down menu not working	1
1173	Installed on Xiaomi Poco X3. Causes my Bluetooth to automatically toggle off&on every 5-10 minutes, which will interrupt the connection to devices.	1
1174	App is easy to use. Is there a way to edit new phone number?	0
1175	It crashes with the new update Also nearby option stopped showing nearby cases since last update	1
1176	Very easy to navigate , this app asks for very little personal info , it is less intrusive than an app download from Google or most social media sites , if this helps keep my self my family and others safe I am more than happy to use it .	0

1182	Always wants to set permissions when I've already set them.	1
1183	This application is really helpful by addressing the challenge of manual contract Tracing. Kudos to the developers!	0
1184	I opened the app and said that I am good no symptoms and left it for a few days and it seems that app was not running since the 4th of August until the 6th when I reopened it, so when I was out on the 5th I could have been in contact with someone (e.g. someone who coughed in KFC). (1. Logs to see when the app last sent data.) (2. New cases in each county per 24 hours) (3. No Storage Permissions required for logging IDs Hi-CPU usage) (4. Weekly notifications something new, needs to be adjusted).	1
1185	Waste of time & effort. It would be easier asking me to ride a camel whilst doing a handstand than perform the tricks needed to confirm ID. Despite it saying opening camera/camcorder, it opens files. If you record the video to then upload, the app restarts and selects 4 new numbers and so it starts again and again and again	1

1188	Good idea but it has led to my phone overheating and battery draining very quickly... Which makes it impractical	1

1194	Not working on Huawei Mate 30	1
1195	Update 17Jun. This app still stops/crashes with no warnings. Hardly worth using it if it stops running when out. Reduced to 1star. My First Review from April: This app is easily closed without any warnings. Make it so it runs always in the background to provide the tracking coverage specified. Thanks.	1
1196	Not sure whose error is this but I cant receive the OTP despite numerous try.	1
1197	Can't even open the app on a galaxy a5 (2017) really bad expireince i expect a bit of more fixes that i can even run the app	1

1230	Drains out battery extremely fast & affect the bluetooth connectivity of other devices, cannot even detect other bluetooth devices at times. Not sure if app works for contact tracing, since it cannot even detect other bluetooth devices at times. However the updated improved version is really significantly better. Kudos to the team hard at work!	1
1231	I really want to keep the COVID safe app on my phone but it's draining my battery so quickly now I have to keep my phone on charge all day. Not viable to keep the app on if I am going to be out all day - which is essentially when I need the app working....	1
1232	Causes bluetooth to turn off and on intermittently when in crowded areas. Making the app unusable if I want to listen to my bluetooth headphones. Same experience with a number of bluetooth headsets.	1
1233	I can't verify my account by entering mobile phone I use.	1
1234	Multiple issues: GPL without source code, open unconnected BT, battery drain, many users report the need to turn off WiFi to register phone number.	1
1235	Suggest to allow app to support older version of andriod if possible. Have a fully functional phone of 4 plus years and hoping not to change it just so I could use the QR code function.	1
1236	Bogus app	1
1237	I can check if the any person around me has cornoa various	0
1238	Hey I liked the app but I think 15 minutes of exposure is too long! As infected person could be coughing/sneezing next to you and then walk away and they won’t be detected as exposure. It only takes less than 1 minute to infect someone!	1
1239	I was told this app would help me buy drugs and so far all I have found is undercover cross-dressing midgets and some really weird animal porn which has since caused me nightmares. Good app for those who like to be watched but not really ideal for those who have serious kinks/fetishes.	1

1264	After the latest update (2.0.15), there seems to be something wrong with the number of 'exchanges' with other trace together users. Previously, even visiting downstairs to the supermarket would show something like 25 exchanges. Today, I went to home team NS adventure centre for my swab test, even after returning my app says 0 exchanges. The app status says it's working fine in the notification box. I've also got Bluetooth turned on by default. Something is wrong.	1
1265	Pointless if you don't have a turkish number or don't speak turkish as 99.9% of tourists.	1
1266	Not showing result	1
1267	i tried many times to register but no msg sent to my mobile number!	1
1268	There should have explanation in the update of the following: The color of the logo has changed from blue to red. It requires more information such as NRIC. Name, etc. I am not comfortable to provide the additional info without clear reason, which was not required in the first version.	1

1272	Useless app, fake can't detect while I am staying with my fellow roommate who is positive.	1
1273	Had to turn off exposure notifications as the app was draining phone battery. Using iPhone 8, iOS 14. Will have to resort to turning them on and off as needed until fix.	1
1274	Very easy to use and good efficiency	0
1275	Thought it would show areas that have cases etc so public can stay away waste of time plus constant GPS and Bluetooth pinging id rather my battery then this the website has more info	1
1276	Once you activate the Bluetooth required for this app it then stops all other devices that use BT from functioning correctly! As the government won't be paying my fine for driving and talking on my phone I have no choice to get rid of this app til you can fix the bugs!	1
1277	I have been trying to register, all informations that i input are correct my bluetooth is open, location service is open, but keeps receiving "error requesting OTP" then when i received the OTP error said "error registering. I had exceeded the the number of activation. Now the app says that I have to call 109, I called and I waited about more than 4day and nobody answered me.	1
1278	Good	0
1279	Until yesterday my app is working .but today i try to open it display big ? Mark. i try to uninstalled and installed again but problem same.

1292	So far so good. BUT, would be good to include a notification log. Plenty of users have reported notifications which can be missed and create stress and anxiety. I know that if it is a close contact the warning should be in red everything you open the app. Still the log would give reassurance. Pls consider. Phones handle messages differently. So haveing a record in the app is essential.	0

Kindly provide an email AND contact number that I can reach the appropriate Singapore Government entity.	1
1323	Downloaded. Tried to register. Got as far as entering my phone number to send a code. Apparently I don't know my own phone number ('number invalid'). I can't be bothered despite all of the hype. Such a good idea wasted.	1
1324	Verification code Kabul etmiyor.... çözer misiniz bu hata.	1
1325	It is not accepting international phone numbers. It says invalid phone number. If you aren't accepting international phone number, why did you add country code selection?	1
1326	A great app	0
1327	There should be an option to add test results manually. I had to take a test, but my doctor didn't want to register my code since "this is only for in the triage centers". Quite useless to use the app if test results can't be reported.	1
1328	My mobile intalltime app logo red colour coming one week later i uptade ne version app logo change black colour why what happend	1
1329	No option to turn off app when not in use. Huge battery drain. Who would have bluetooth enabled always? Regardless of your internal testing and statistics, basing your data on the consumption % displayed on a Samsung phone is not the correct way. It is a known fact that the battery consumption is not accurate and you did not consider the consumption by bluetooth radio in your faq.	1
1330	Can save you so is worth a try	0
1331	There is no edit facility to enable a change in recorded information why?????	1
1332	This app is causing too many problems with Bluetooth devices.. Ever since I installed the app, my car can't connect automatically so I have to manually do it every time. The same goes for my Fitbit...	1

1363	Very good app for covid 19 too detect the area	0
1364	Recent update was the worse. I have been using this since launch and had no issue until recent update. The app cannot detect nearby users with bluetooth, and is a battery monster. Have uninstall already.	1

1366	Downloaded app a few weeks ago due to work requirement. All was ok though app uses battery ALOt. 2 day ago the app got updated, since then im not able to validate my personal details.. I hv tried uninstall and reinstalled app but it still doesn't work. Pls advise Update on 5.6.2020 : Keyed in NRIC date of issue. Not resolved Update 6.6.2020 : Issue resolved. Thank you for your assistance. Stay safe!	1
1367	After I install the app I cannot open the app when I open it closes on itself please help I cannot go out without this. Please help	1
1368	Still illogical to keep this app in phone just for formality by our govt.	1
1369	Sometimes app crush or hang byself	1
1370	Is it possible to make it available on HUAWEI App Gallery too? Using P40 Pro.	1
1371	Good our health carer	0
1372	Good	0
1373	I feel this app should give you a date or date range of your possible exposure, while I appreciate the need for privacy, a date would give you more information on who that you have seen could possibly also be at risk and need to take precautions. You should be able to utilize some of the data you provide. Right now it is a bit vague and makes it challenging to understand your own risk levels.	0

1401	Best app	0
1402	Pointless. The idea of the app was to help to automate contact tracing (anyone who has been near the user for a duration over the past 21 days). Government health officials have disclosed that of 6.5 million downloads, there have been exactly zero people it has traced using the app from those who have contracted Covid-19.. So, not sure if it does anything beneficial.	1
1403	Keep getting \u201cThere seems to be an Internet issue". Unable to complete installation	1
1404	I was using it mainly for the radius alerts. I think you're overriding the previous state of the pins with every new update. Which makes it slightly problematic considering that's the one feature that made this application really useful.	1
1405	Did not send me an otp after so many tries. Redownload also won't work.	1

1432	downloaded it but the self isolation booking is not there, tried to re install but still same..	1
1433	Completely useless, you would expect live data and a further breakdown of data within each county all you get is static figures that provide no value! I expect someone got paid a lot of money to create this useless app	1
1434	Can't download the app, my phone's memory still available tho	1
1435	It won't valid my number and my mum can't even download it. Very disappointed I hope this app gets a lot better.	1
1436	Doesn't remember my details	1
1437	My mom is using a very old phone model and the "latest update" stopped at android ver 4.x... so we cannot download this app which only supported ver 5.1 above.	1

1448	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

1456	working well	0
1457	Very bad experience.. This app need location should be ON always. And bluetooth was switching on automatically. Because of this GPS and bluetooth mobile battery was drying quickly. How visitors will register without QID number?	1
1458	I opened the app and said that I am good no symptoms and left it for a few days and it seems that app was not running since the 4th of August until the 6th when I reopened it, so when I was out on the 5th I could have been in contact with someone (e.g. someone who coughed in KFC). (1. Logs to see when the app last sent data.) (2. New cases in each county per 24 hours) (3. No Storage Permissions required for logging IDs Hi-CPU usage) (4. Weekly notifications something new, needs to be adjusted).	1
1459	Can’t believe it took so long to just let it run in  all across Canada. Is it gonna be up when Covid-19 is gone?	1
1460	Good initiative. However, my phone number starting with 89 is not usable as it says invalid singapore phone number (I'm using circles life). Kindly look into this matter please.	1
1461	This app ran reasonable well in the previous iteration, but the latest update (which now requires location to be on where it didn't previously) is a massive drain on the battery - to the point where I'm charging continuously throughout the day when I have the opportunity.	1
1462	Not very useful if it will only load onto\niPhones with iOS 13.5. What do people with\nOlder systems do.  Die?	1
1463	Uninstalled because your "close contact" criteria is useless for me. All my contscts are much shorter than 15 mins, and still, as I get out for shopping etc, I have a chance to contact with the virus. And app will not detect such a contact as something it should inform me. So, this app can give false security feeling. I don't need this. It maybe a bit useful for people who are still working with others Reduce the time, increase the distance. We have enough tests available now as far as I know	1
1464	Despite countless feedback about battery consumption since it's inception, nothing has been done to address this problem. Stop wasting people's time by asking for details of our phone's firmware as I do not see anyone addressing the issue of battery drainage till now. Huge disappointment in this programme as well as wasting tax payers money paying for it as problems unsolved for months. If it's not ready, do not force the people into a corner to make it mandatory.	1
1465	Fake	1
1466	Today 7dec in the morning 10 to 12nn, I am unable to setup my trace together app. I have key in my details ic name dob , but it says webpage respond is blocked. Pl help	1
1467	Excellent	0
1468	If government overreach was an app	1
1469	Everybody's main concern for a contact tracing app made by the government is "Will this track my location?" This is a completely valid concern seeing as mass surveillance has been a growing concern in the digital age. This app accomplishes privacy in two ways: only using Bluetooth to check if you've been next to someone infected with coronavirus and using encrypted anonymous data. This app is also secure as the code is 100% open source for everybody to view.	0
1470	Samsung j5 2017. Does not work. No data , no ram used. Not a peep	1
1471	This app is draining my battery so much. My phone autoically goes into battery saver because this app would drain my phone in hours otherwise. Update: Uninstalled, went from 100% to 45% in two hours with little usage. Cultprit? This app.	1

1477	I've had to take this app off my phone for the 2nd time due to how quickly it runs down the battery. This time my phone was also incredibly hot and I assumed it had just reached the end of its life (it's a Samsung, 3.5 yrs old). Then I came across comments online about this app, battery life and making your phone over heat. I deleted it and my phone is fine again! I'm hopeless with technology but can anyone give some tips on how I can reinstall without the battery and over heating issues?	1
1478	This is the worst app I've ever seen. After app update, it goes to inactive mode. What a shame?? Finally decided to uninstall this today. I need to save some battery, which is this app only capable of.	1

1510	Followed advice & deleted 2 older apps to free up storage. Tried again. It is still in a "Pending" status. All my other apps work, the only one trying to update is NHS. It's NHS update Got a recommendation to upgrade the app but all you see is the "washing machine" going round, and round, and round..... still in a pending state and you cannot go back and use the previous version. Wanted to check a medical appointment but now can't. Does not look like this upgrade release has been fully tested!!	1

1513	The worst user experience on this app... I am facing the same issue as the rest of rhe people on this review side and i hope they fix it cuz of the obligatory purpose this has that it needs to be shown to every store people have to go to... so why not expand the services on this app and not have such limitations either for the people and for the help desk... we both cannot do anything for this "Exceeded limit of attempt" and other related issues.	1
1514	Keeps saying my phone number is invalid	1
1515	It crashes continually	1

1562	Stay safe ph it is a very good working great application because I love this application and good working application and nice application.	0
1563	Enabling bluetooth and running in the background at all times is not only detrimental to the battery life of the device, but also opens up a hole in the device's security. I knew I was taking a gamble by downloading this app, taking in account the experiences I have had with other government applications, but now I am sure that I shan't ever download one of these things again. It's simply appalling.	1

1577	Extremely poorly developed app. The amount of permission controls required just to allow the app to run makes my device a vulnerability to hacks. There is really no reason for bluetooth to always be on when location information is allowed. It should not have the permission to modify my contents on my phone. Also why does it need to make calls on my phone. A lot of these issues and vulnerabilities needs to be addressed.	0

1633	The apps keeps stopping by itself multiple times. But I still hope that the information is valid.	1
1634	The app shows I have 300+ to 700+ exchanges in a day when i don't even go out of the house \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Does it scan the whole building? My housemates only have 2 or 3 a day. My app is up to date.	1
1635	When there are a lot of people nearby, eg shopping mall . MRT, it causes Bluetooth disconnected and reconnected 5s later. Results my Bluetooth earphones can't use normally. Work around: force stop this app.	1
1636	Can the developers of this app please confirm when the battery drain issue will be fixed? I will have no option but to uninstall (reluctantly) if this problem persists. Contact with developers. Told to uninstall and download again. Battery drain is still as bad.	1
1637	It is very bad because when I am puting my number it is showing invalid number. It is right then also	1
1638	Very good follow up.	0

1651	Don't say you'll do anything for your family if you haven't downloaded this App	0
1652	Good idea, can be developed and improved further.	0
1653	Be nice if it worked. Despite having the battery optimisation turned off for this app, it keeps coming up "inactive" and telling me to change the setting. I agree and it says active. A few minutes later I get a notification that it's inactive again.	1

1663	So far easy enough. Downloaded and appears to be ok. Only know it's there as I have a message on my screen saying if that message disappears then I need to restart my phone. As long as I don't get spam or covid I'd give it a 5 star \ud83d\ude09	0

1675	Installed easily on Samsung S10 and runs in the background even if you close apps. Everyone should download. Apple and Google know more about you than this app even will so stop with the whole privacy thing, get over it you are nothing special so just downloaded so we can all move on from corona	1
1676	It's won't let me join, it says my phone number is invalid.? Have deleted the app restarted my phone and still can't join. If anyone can help that would be great.	1
1677	My phone number has been deemed invalid so I can't sign up	1
1678	This app took up my storage and drained my battery, so it's not that helpful to me at all. It was saying on the radios that u should download it so I did, and it wouldn't let me out of the app. I'm very disappointed in this app.	1
1679	This app is now totally unreliable as it crashes on startup. Needs urgent attention from the app developer.	1

1689	Latest version requires Location to be switched ON to work As I never have location ON the app is now useless I assume. The earlier version of the app only needs Location permission, with Location turned off the app still works, no longer.	1
1690	App was fine other than chewing through my battery, I have deleted it atm as I\u2019m not leaving the house so when I do go back to leaving the house again I with activate again	1

1741	good idea	0
1742	It keeps showing me the same potential exposure over and over and over and I say "no" every time and it continues to ask me the same place over and over. Really stressful to get this notification at all, let alone when it doesn't mean anything.	1
1743	Why its showing (?) Mark.	1

1746	Worst!	1
1747	I have a month-old phone and I still needed to update my OS to download this app. This app is more effective the more people that use it, but it’s extremely inaccessible since you have to have the most recent OS. I wish they would change that!	1
1748	Am having trouble registering myself (pink IC holder). Its reading my IC as invalid. Amusingly.	1

1787	App really suck. Can't even go pass otp process	1
1788	Great idea, but doesn't work. Battery optimisation keeps reverting to incorrect setting, meaning the app isnt active... Have tried locking the app on my oppo r11s, and turning the Background Freeze and Abnormal Apps Optimisation off, but it still turns the battery optimisation on and shuts down the app	0
1789	I have a question my dad is not a smartphone user so he can't have this app what to do	1
1790	What a waste of time and money. Over $1.7 million went to non Australian companies to pay for the app and no cases have been found that have already been found with manual tracing. The Australian government could have at least used Australian companies for the job. Yet another waste of taxpayer money.	1
1791	I tried to subscribe with my Turkey phone number, i could not get the sms. I tried with my Austria phone number, i could not get sms. Can someone tell me in how many days we can get the sms? Turk vatandasiyim. Once yurtdisindan gelip sonrasinda yurtici ucus yapacagim. Tr ve yurtdisi hattimla kayit olmaya calistim, sms gelmiyor. Bilet alacagim alamiyorum.	1

Will fix it in future versions. I say come out with the next version ASAP. When virus spread, it doesn't wait for next version. Imagine a break in contact tracing just because of an App failure.	1

1828	Tried to download on an elderly relative's Samsung phone but the app isn't compatible. Nowhere can I find a list of compatible devices or Android versions. Sadly the app won't help the most vunerable.	1
1829	Good app	0
1830	I turned on the apl all the time. But the bluetooth function on my mobile suddenly became faulty. I believe the tracetogether app consumes alot of power on bluettooth chip and bluetooth chip works 24\u00d77 without stopping , this caused the bluetooth chip broken down. I am not aware that BT chip is broken down and not aware the app has stopped. Please do optimization on the bluetooth function to consume lesser power when it is required to run all time.	1
1831	Very useful app. Gives important information. Really glad that it has the tracker ability and can notify me if necessary.	0
1832	Great app and great UI but I feel like it should include more languages (Maori, Chinese, Japanese etc).	0

1836	It’s simple and easy to use. There’s no bug and I like how fast this was created for the benefit of our safety. However it would be great if it could work on the background. I constantly forgot to switch the app on when I’m out with others or to work. And when travelling it can be boring for me as I took 1.5 hour to travel to work. But other then that, I try my best to switch it on when I’m out.	0

1838	Installed since initial launch, working fine in background untill recent update. Keeps disappearing from background and need to constantly check phone to ensure it is running in background.	1
1839	Excellent aap	0
1840	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
1841	Edit: the Bluetooth exchange seems to be back to normal and I'm able to see more exchanges from 10 Oct. Thank you!	1
1842	I cannot use the app as it is unable to connect to the internet.	1
1843	Great app! \nYou should add an in-app share button, the app would spread faster than covid.	0

1867	Could not get past the 6 number pin that was sent to me. Kept sending me back to the beginning again. It would keep starting again after you try to register. I found it frustrating and useless in trying. So I deleted the app.	1
1868	I like the app and what it's intended for and have used it diligently since installing it. On 8th Aug both my phone and my wifes phone started getting getting hot, losing battery life faster. It's like something got dialled up in the app. I reluctantly disabled it for that reason.	1

1896	I have installed this app. Accepted to access my phone for managing calls & device location. but it is asking for access to my personal files i.e access for photos, media & files on this device. How can I share my personal data. If I deny it I can't open the application. Please advise, how to open the application for registration.	1
1897	Is this normal? The APP keeps crashing. It should be fully functional if the general public will use this.	1
1898	App was very quick and straight forward to setup and register. Those who had trouble with this may have been entering their mobile number beginning with zero?  The zero needs to be left off. Looking forward to seeing how effective this technology is.	0

1923	Good little app, great to see it rolled out. I have struggled to get the QR code’s to scan at some premises, they come up as invalid and I am then using my phone camera which takes me to another site. Would be good to manually be able to enter details into the app without requiring a at code so we don’t have to scan other codes.	0
1924	Dear developer. Thanks for your response. I'm using Samsung S10+. With this app, the battery only last me 6/7 hours of a day. My work requires me extensive use of the phone. Hence, I have to carry a battery pack with me wherever I go. As my phone ages, I'm sure the battery power will drain much faster. There is no point for this app if users phone batteries cannot last the whole time that they are out and about. Not sure about the privacy portion....	1
1925	Super app	0
1926	I am using Samsung Note 8. After I downloaded the app, the BT connectivity with other BT devices was impacted. Cannot detect or no connection. Update the app several times but problem remain.	1

1935	It states I have an invalid phone number, and didn't accept it with or without the 0 in front. I wonder how many people will try to help out but can't even register.	1
1936	App is always deactivating by itself and nothing tells me it did. And when it's activaed, it asks the permission to run in the background. Why can't it register the permission ? Edit 31/10/20: Since yesterday I had to allow background permission three times!	1

I  cannot plan my trip and cannot do covid test every day at 370 aed.

1958	After the latest update this APP has now become a TRACKING APP. It no longer just requires Bluetooth. It now requires Location Data. The government is now tracking you so if you don't want that (which you shouldn't) then uninstall this app. It is now a risk to your privacy and your security.	1

1977	App is good! Maybe you could send a push notification if someone swipes up to close the TT app, as some of us might actually do that, and forget to let it run in the background sometimes. Other than that, it’s easy to use!	0
1978	Just, useless. Wanted to do my part in the pandemic, this app appears to be useless in actually tracing anything. No info on its efficacy and it hasn't prevented a single case so there really is no point to this app.	1
1979	Imma try this out	0
1980	Helpful app	0
1981	I have installed it because I have to for work not because I want to. The fact it drops the Bluetooth connection for other devices like a cars hands free is really annoying and it is killing the battery life of my mobile phone, even though I have a s20 ultra with the improved battery. The app needs a lot of work especially since the government is pushing it big time to the public.	1
1982	Excellent monitoring apps	0
1983	Useless trash	1
1984	It's not so informative as expected. Asking all personal details like ID, age, health conditions, even asking if you work in the health sector, but after all what you can see is just the fact you live in a risky place. I knew it before, but thought I would be able to get more details rather than something general. You can't find any further specific data about a particular area, neither the number of cases in your location nor the marks of the buildings with the infected people living there.	1
1985	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

1990	The App as such seems great,gives good information about Covid stats but the assessment questionnaire needs further improvement.The questionnaire needs to be more interactive and intuitive for better understanding of patient health status.Also , the see your recent contacts feature (bit annoying) doesn't really give the user any real information besides the fact that there might be n number of recent contacts that may or may not be at risk. There is no info about which contact it might be.	1

1999	Validation failed... No feedback or support.	1

2007	App works great ! How about allowing the user to record temperature within the app and allowing express entry without temperature checks if it has already been recorded. This will encourage more people to check their own temperatures and also allow quicker entry into places where there’s usually a queue to check temperature e.g at mall entrances. Thanks !!	0

2052	It's a plain invasion on the privacy of the people, such apps doesn't need to have permission to access bluetooth, phone and gallery or any other related stuff. This kind of application and approach is not good for the people! We are living in a internet based society, you don't need short range connections like bluetooth to be always on, you can access location but not our files this is just an application that drains everyones phone batteries it doesn't even does it's job properly	1
2053	Does what it is supposed to do, only notifications are when Bluetooth is off obviously, as it requires Bluetooth.	1
2054	Excellent app for the whole family amen to know about the corona virus outbreak	0
2055	Good effort but this does not work on my phone please make it better to work on older mobile phones	0
2056	This app is focussed and good in intent and execution. One change which would in my opinion add to the appeal and efficacy of the app would be enhanced if statistics for past seven days was added. The "from start to date" graph is unhelpful to the extent that it does not reflect recoveries and discharges from hospital.	1

2124	Had to uninstall it due to the affect it had on my phone, during a phone conversation if my phone connected with any other phones with the app via Bluetooth it would go straight into loud speaker mode and blow my eardrum.

2161	Can not start, keep chrasing	1
2162	Too good	0
2163	When I use the app, my Bluetooth headset experience goes for a toss. However, I hope it is just a temporary sacrifice that we have to make for the greater good.	1
2164	Intermittent disruptions to my phone's (Xperia 5) bluetooth connection with my car audio. This is clearly a widespread issue (anecdotal and reviews) that is not limited to any smartphone and audio brand. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does scan QR code amazingly fast so good job there.	1
2165	Unable to get past "waiting for download". My phone is 2 yrs. old. Samsung J6.	0
2166	Very useful	0
2167	I can't understand this app	1
2168	App can no longer scan QR codes at businesses. Reinstalled and worked then. This time that "fix" is not working. Phone model Vivo V15 Pro.	1
2169	It's beyond belief to wait for 15mins of close contact with a positive case before contact tracing is actioned.	1
2170	Very easy to download and use this app. Has a wealth of up to date information. Reassuring to know that if I have been in contact with anyone who gets covid-19 I can be contacted. Will inevitably help constrain this virus.	0

2214	Okay. On the phone to MANY dead ends. People putting the phone down on me. Eventually, Western Cape Department of Health call center person said to me that the App doesn’t work. \nI strongly suggested that they remove the app from the App Store and PUBLICISE the fact that it is not working. I said that by giving a false sense of security regarding exposures far more dangerous to his situation than not having an App.	1

2227	Nice	0
2228	The QR scanning doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple locations and it always says that it isn't a recognised Safe entry QR code. And the feedback/contact us doesn't work either. So hence my review here. Can't be a phone issue. Singpass and the phone's built in scanner works fine.	1
2229	This app is very good but it can be imptoved if it does not use mobile data and submit the info once is connected with wifi	0
2230	It really tell true information THANKS	0

2232	Excellent	0
2233	I inspected my workers phones and when they tried to switch on the bluetooth function on the app, it is not able to. I tried the permission settings on the phone and tried again and it doesn't work. Is the app compatible to all phones??	1
2234	Concept is great but poorly made. Drains battery on S7 within a few hours.	1
2235	My battery has been draining constantly. Yesterday, the 9th, I deleted the app. Reinstalled it last night. Went to bed, with 90% battery to wake to it being down to 15%. Despite liking the app and the concept behind it, I've since deleted the app and hope there are no long term affects on my battery. My phone is less than 2 months old, Huwaei P30 Pro.	1
2236	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
2237	cant register.. after click accept t&c network error pop out.. dont have problem with my network..	1
2238	So stupid. All my details are correctly keyed in and the app keep saying "verification failed, please check all fields on red". Is it I don't know my own name and NRIC???	1
2239	Battery killer, uninstalled until it's fixed.	1
2240	Suggest to allow app to support older version of andriod if possible. Have a fully functional phone of 4 plus years and hoping not to change it just so I could use the QR code function.	1
2241	Got Covid-19 tested twice recently, the result from ALHOSN was quite fast. I got the result within 24 hours. That's owesome!	0

2249	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

2262	Refusing to work on Huawei P40 Pro and not able to receive OTP. All permissions set including battery usage as recommended. Installed via Google Play Store with GMS installed (not via HMS).	1
2263	App signup was simple enough, though it wouldn't let me paste in my pin number, but there's something that doesn't add up. Location services is claimed to be required for Bluetooth, but I had no trouble giving the app Bluetooth access without location services being enabled. Combined with the refusal to release the source code (as an open source developer myself, I looked forward to reassuring friends and family it was safe), I will not be continuing to use this.	0
2264	App interferes with other bluetooth devices like my ear buds. The disruption is pretty bad where it distorts my music every few secs. My ear buds works perfectly and everything goes back to normal once I pause the app.	1
2265	I am unable to update my info. Gives error.	0
2266	While I understand the possible need to scan the QR code the first we are at the location (as opposed to finding it on a list like the Singpass app - Safe Entry), one handy feature that is missing from the Trace Together app that would be good to have is having your favorites show up based on your location rather than showing the full list (reference how Singpass app- Safe Entry handles their favourites)	1
2267	Abit strange recently I have very little exchange even when i took mrt... Used to have at least a few hundreds exchanges if im out for half a day... Can u check your system? Today i have 0 exchange, how can it be? I out to work, took buses & mrt rides...	1
2268	good	0
2269	Hangs my phone	1
2270	Given the app permission to auto start but it's not doing that....	1
2271	Not sure how well it works, but it screws up the Bluetooth connectivity with other devices. My earpiece have to be re-paired everytime I want to use it. And most times cannot be done (which never happened before I downloaded this app). Please fix it. Super frustrating!	1

2278	Very good for the people.	0
2279	Its a good app	0
2280	Works well and with no privacy issues. There are things that could be improved. 1. A reminder each day to check in. 2. A map with current hot spots so the rest of us can avoid them. 3. Current (local) restrictions. 4. More stats so we can see how things are progressing 5. Breakdown stats are out of date. A recent update did provide more, but the graphs on the Wikipedia are still better. e. g. in the first spike the number of people in hospital was the big warning of the forthcoming death rate.	0
2281	Needs a push reminder to check in. Also while real time is stats is important overall cases like in the previous version and sadly deaths per country would be v helpful to have as well with links to the hse covid hub for futher information and links to maps.	1

2307	Well intended idea, but won't accept my phone number in any way, shape, or form. Giving up! I assume the numbers of downloads the government are touting are from people uninstalling and reinstalling the app, not actual people using the app.	1

2312	Not good! Always interfering with my bluetooth when connected to earphones or the car. Please fix it. It's annoying! But I have to have this app for work.	1
2313	I know this is the first release and it looks really well. Down the line I would like to see number of active cases and active cases broke down by county. Also, have live daily updates i.e. how many news cases, deaths etc. Narrow down areas where there are clusters. Hopefully you will gather some useful data and trends. Best of luck with the app.	0

2349	How to get more downloads on your app? 1) say its optional but highly recommended 2) force your conscripts into downloading it 3) ??? 4) PROFIT! What you gonna do? CHARGE ME LORH! But srsly, yes the pandemic is a serious problem. You guys can say you have state of the art security measures in place to prevent security breaches. But what you gonna do when it does get out? The most you can say is 'too bad we'll do better'. Is it a problem if ppl don't want to download it due to privacy concerns?	1

After 3hours dead battery Had to factory restore the phone as deleting and uninstalling the app had no effect. WILL I REINSTALL THIS APP ?, as one who installed this app within a few hours of it being released and was keen to do my part to help stop the spread of the virus hmm I won't be as quick this time!	1
2363	I have been having an issue with the app.. Go to settings ~App~choose ehteraz~delete data~then register your details again.... Worked for me , hope I works for you too.	1

2387	Won't stay active on my Oppo phone, keep having to allow battery optimisation setting, works for no more than 10 minutes and becomes inactive again, so completely pointless even having it installed at the moment.	1
2388	Great to find out this app is part of the Linux Foundation public health project, one of few that implement GAEN. Although it does not seem to be the best engineered and truly useful app for the purpose, the UI is good and provides useful stats. Lately, It started draining my phone (Samsung S7) battery at about 1% per min when Bluetooth was kept off at night (keeps polling for BT?) and hogs otherwise, though may not be the case on all phones. IMO use of GPS data along BT might have been useful, BT alone does not seem to be of much use, perhaps it is more of the available phone device platforms that restrict potential capabilities of this app otherwise I am sure the Developers would have done an even excellent job.	1
2389	There was bug when calling or receive call, screen goes off even hang up phone.	1

2411	Update 10.08.20: Deleted cache and all data from Google Play Services and battery use seems to have stabilised. Like the app but have would recommend some tweaks: - Daily confirmed cases graph covers too broad a timeline. Would be better to have a week by week option to show trends. - Cases/deaths stats should show daily or weekly movement comparisons. -Total cases per county is fairly meaningless, ignores population density for one.	1
2412	I think it's a great idea and the app works perfectly fine......I highly recommend that everyone downloads it because at the end of the day wouldn't you like to know if you have come in close contact with someone that has the Coronavirus.	0

2428	Easy to register and was pretty straight forward with how its supposed to work. Hope it makes a difference.	0
2429	I can understand the need for this app, but at the the moment; the cons outweigh the pros. On paper, using our devices to help pinpoint potential hotspots sounds like a good idea. But due to the fact that the app not only needs to always run in the background (even in power saving), it's constant access to location turning a 4day battery into 6 hours and consistent interruption of Bluetooth devices make this more of a hastle, rather then a utility. Please fix the Bluetooth and battery issues	1
2430	Seriously, you need more detail in your release notes. If you've snuck something in that utilises geo-coordinates without telling me, I'm going to be apoplectic in the moments before I uninstall the app. If you want usage, we want transparency!	1
2431	I m in self isolation now my beaware app is not working. I can not register due to different nos in app and at desk for covid please help me to solve this issue.	1
2432	Staysafe ph is fantastic application it is very important and useful application developer have done great work on it.....	0
2433	Downloading the app was really easy! I'm experiencing just one issue on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom running ColorOS 6: although I've already given the app permission to run on background and ignore battery optimisation settings, it still shows a "x". Maybe this issue can be fixed by not trying to detect battery optimisation permissions on ColorOS because I think it's not classified as such.	1
2434	Will not accept my phone number. Tried many times kept telling me my number was invalid. So uninstall	1
2435	Very quick and easy to install. And definitely more privacy oriented than most apps on my phone. Let's all keep looking after each other as we walk this path together.	0

2450	Easy download. Non invasive info. Runs in the background. Like the invite you can send others to encourage to download. Anything to track covid and stay safe is gotta be good and will help us all get back to some kind of normality. Like that the gvt are trying different things.	0
2451	Handles privacy really well. I'm curious why it doesn't tell you how many contacts you have. But I suspect there is a technical reason for that.	0
2452	Why does it always ask for bluetooth when the blue tooth is on? Does any1 knows?	1
2453	I can't access the app. It keeps saying my number isn't registered...wrong credentials. Not a good app at all.	1

2458	The Battery Optimisation option says it's on but needs me to allow the permission every time I open the app. Even when I allow it, it will turn itself off when I'm trying to use it out, and then make the app not active. It causes me great concern.	1

2477	District wise statistics should be maintained. Test centers and Treatment centers must be provided district wise, it is difficult to search through the whole state.	1
2478	Easy to use and install. Only 4 stars because I would like to see a record of how many contacts recorded per day or week. It would help people adjust their behaviour and keep unnecessary contacts to a minimum. Also county data could be time listed, not just cumulative.	0
2479	This is a great idea to trace out contacts. But it probably work ,when maximum parentage of the population were checked out their RT-PCR and when the greater number ( seems 95%) of the population using an android device. Otherwise it can't helpful.	0

2501	I am not getting OTP number in my Nokia 6 mobile.login problem happens	1
2502	I contracted COVID-19 on a routine trip to the grocery store. My case was largely asymptomatic; if it weren’t for the alert I received on this app, I wouldn’t have known to get tested and I might have unknowingly put others at risk.	0
2503	This app is completely useless. It cannot even identify the OTP that has been sent through their system. Waste of memory and time.	1
2504	This app is so lousy. Cannot be installed on Huawei phones and androids of older OS. It also must be connected to wifi or mobile data. It also cannot use the QR scanner as an independent entity for SafeEntry, so without internet access this app is useless. Should have more languages too.	1
2505	When I do the check in, the number of people logo uses a light green background with white text. Cannot read that from a distance and the ambassador had to come close to read.	1

Not happy hopefully it hasn't killed my phone!	1
2512	I would give it 5 stars and a great review but everytime I check in it keeps telling me it doesn't support my device contact tracing cannot be used which it did before the last app update I'm gonna uninstall the app if you's don't fix it	0

2524	The battery is draining like crazy. Its not practical to keep the app running if you do not have an alternative power source. Can the developers fix this ASAP?	1
2525	This app causes MAJOR connectivity issues between my device and Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones or speakers. I have seen and spoken to many other people reporting a similar issue; I have attempted to contact support on 3 separate occasions but have yet to receive any response, and the latest major update seemed to not address this fix - infact, it appeared to make it worse! This is a major software issue, especially if you are trying to encourage widespread use of this app.	1

2537	I dropped the 0 from the front of my number, but still comes back invalid number	1
2538	OTP does not seem to be working on newer Huawei phone series, for example Huawei Nova. It is ridiculous to believe that the developer of this app is not able to able to develop something that is compatible with the phone series that are being sold in Singapore when the Government is encouraging citizens to use this app.	1

2547	Great app, easy to register for. Only downside is the persistent notification. This is quite annoying and very much not needed. Maybe instead of having a persistent notification, just send a notification when the app is no longer tracking, reminding the user to restart to app or restart their phone.	0

2551	Every time I scanned QR code in many locations (shopping malls & shops), it won't work properly or recognized the QR code maybe due to too many users at one go. Then due to it must use Bluetooth function, battery consumption is very very high. Why can't it be using normal Wifi that Safe Entry is using.... And is so frustrating to keep scanning QR Code & it can't read...Sigh!	1

Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).	0

2691	Drain my battery life, deleting this app. Dont ask me send report to ur support team, quite obvious when ur app ask us to turn on Bluetooth indefinitely.	1
2692	It doesn't even work	1
2693	Good	0
2694	?t worked fine until the other day. Now my permanent HES code isn't coming up but when I search it the app doesn't recognize me as the user. Someone must have spilled tea on their keyboard when updating the program. #turkiye	1

2701	This is a very good application, it is also very Easy to use,	0
2702	It was working well when I first installed it around October but now, everytime I try to use it, the app crashes (already reinstalled it thinking it will get fixed -but still crashes). More annoying than useful really considering it's the preferred contact tracing app here where I live. ??????	1
2703	Easy and I love it it makes me feel more safe	0
2704	Like it alot as its optimised for user experience in terms of the number of clicks.	0
2705	Giving this 5 stars because it is in English. Thank you very much for that	0
2706	Excessive permissions... Requesting full access is unnecessary... Many countries are doing same thing but without asking all these permissions and they are working fine.	0
2707	Lots of disruption when using bluetooth wireless earpiece. Issue should be address.	1
2708	Works great... I would love a little daily tally... Like "you have been in contact with X number of people today".... Could really help shine a light on how close people are getting to others, lowering their "contact footprint".	0

2716	What's wrong with this App? I can't even log in goodness! I registered cause I thought this will help me but instead what i get us trouble logging in.	1
2717	Installed the app day one on a Samsung Galaxy S10. No problems to date, though It seems to use slightly more Battery; not enough to be concerned over though.	1
2718	Good better then last time .	0
2719	Pile off rubbish .	1
2720	It is a need otherwise I would never install this app..the developer is very much aligned to complete a feature rather than thinking about the user..it just sticks on notification pane and shows error via if construct..like if bluetooth is off show error..if location is off show error.. Also this app stops working if internet is switched off	1
2721	Nice app	1
2722	Its a good app but the check in and check out button are too close to each other, so I may accidentally check out when I want to check in to a certain place. Please keep them further apart!	0
2723	Good	0
2724	Wonderful idea, but has some functionality issues. Enabling tracing is a little buggy if you don't do it upon setup, but otherwise a very useful app which should help us through these troubling times.	0
2725	App is interfering with all my Bluetooth earphones making them disconnect and connect especially when in crowded places. Fix this asap.	1
2726	I have tried over several days to download this app on my Android Samsung S7. Software is up-to-date and correct operating system. About to give up.	1
2727	Nice	0
2728	It's not working now.. seems govt has started hiding the real number of cases now.. cases are increasing day by day and here they are manipulating the facts	1
2729	Generally don't notice the app running at all; UPDATED - haven't experienced the below for some time now. however started using the phone for music in the car today and it constantly causes the cars Bluetooth to reset about 1-2 minutes into each song. Phone = Samsung S9+ Car = Mazda BT50 2014 (Don't know what version of Bluetooth) Hopefully you can resolve this issue.	1
2730	Hi, Come out a fix so that even non SG users whose Google Play has been set overseas able to download this app. Now my workplace,many problems, non-sg citizens whose GP is overseas country registered can't download due to prompt that the country in use must be SG. Thks	1
2731	very good app	0
2732	I've installed the app because my love for our community far outweighs my paranoia - just do it!	0
2733	GOOD	0
2734	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0

2742	Hi, in the last 30 hours my Samsung A5 keeps reporting that Covid App is hogging CPU and phone needs to be restarted. Indeed a full battery charge is drained in a few hours and phone is very hot to touch. I checked online, did a few things like cleaning Google play service cache etc. Even Unistalled Play service updates but still the same. In the end I had to uninstall Covid App which is NOT something I want to do. You guys wrote this App. You need to investigate and revert clear message.	1
2743	Excellent	0
2744	Doesn't actually work	1
2745	good app	0
2746	Seems all good to me. No issues with a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.	0
2747	Would the software be burnt into a chip and incorporate into a handband? If it could - then distribute the handband to all Singaporean and make it mandatory to wear it when leaving the house. No point of wasting time and energy in solving the bluetooth interference with headphones, etc.... The objective is to trace 'closed contact'. It is the effectiveness that counts and it must be abled to seperate data measured at 1 metre distance, 2 metre distance, 3 metre distance, etc..to 10 metre	1
2748	Decided to pull the app off my devices. A10 battery stats - app has high battery drain while running in background. I'm not a tech guy, but I'm eliminating apps that suck juice.. On stock Android 9, I had problem. So i decided to use custom ROM on A10 (just before the devs replied, so I couldn't follow up since different OS). When paused, can't even back out of the app which means it's actually in foreground. Play Store says app may not be optimised for my device. I go get token. Stay safe!	1
2749	Good One. Congratulations all who works behind this	0

2777	App crash whenever SafeEntry check-in is tapped on is fixed for me. The new design is nice. However, would appreciate if the app were to adopt the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API (this setting is now shown as being “not available in your region” in settings).	1
2778	Good	0
2779	I re-install the app because it keeps on logging, consume too much battery on my phone and drained it and for some reason I cannot access the app. When I try to log in it says that "Error Requesting OTP.. Try again". I tried to log in several times but it won't work. I hope the app developer resolve this issue thank you.	1
2780	Hello, yet again I find it app inconsistent as to why the daily cases are not being maintained and as of today 27th Dec , the app mi is are still as of the 24th Dec. It's really not good enough 9 months on not to be getting the daily updates.	1
2781	Horrible experience i enterd my details completely and correctly and it said temporarily unavailable	1
2782	It interferes with all my bluetooth devices. Cannot listen to songs nor watch videos. It will cause my videos and songs to stop abruptly for 30s to a min. But once uninstalled, my songs and videos plays normally.	1

2791	Force closes on first screen	0
2792	I can't register.. please fix and test before you make this app live.. get better IT.	1
2793	UPDATE: You can turn this app off and on! To turn off: Settings->Apps->CovidSafe->Force Stop->Ok To turn it on again before you go out: Start app like any other. Hanging out for the source code. Sampling theory suggests it only needs to check once every minute and record a contact if it can ping the othe phone 14 times in 15 minutes Original Review: A real battery hog. I want to be able to shut it down when I'm at home. Also having a lot of trouble with my Fitbit app when this running.	1
2794	Nice formula and trick on covid19	0
2795	App drains power, any fixes to the app for next release Why bluetooth need to be always on? Can't it only be manually switch on by user when using the App? Why App must always run at the background?	1

2884	Seriously draining my battery in the last 24 hours. Went to bed friday night with 60% battery and had 6% when I woke up. I have the new S20, and my battery usually lasts 24 to 36 hours from full charge. If it happens again today will be uninstalling.	1
2885	Good to have such a crucial app developed in crisis like this.	0
2886	in my opinion, after I install this application I can immediately assess this application as a garbage application with reason, this application takes a lot of battery, many features that need to be activated, including GPS, one of which is famous as the largest consumer resource and damaging my network connections. I will no longer think about installing this application back on my device until it can run more efficiently in terms of battery consumption, connectivity and resource consumption.	1

2889	Useless... My mom was suffering from Covid and I admitted her in hospital.

And its useless as per my personal experience.	1

2894	Kindly fix asap.	1
2895	Good app. This will be very useful when it comes to contact tracing. Just one issue I noticed. The other Bluetooth devices attached, will intermittently get disconnected, or their normal operation is interfered with. You should try to fix this.	0
2896	Effectively for covid status updates.	0
2897	20/3 tip: the OTP always doesnt work on the first try. Hard close the app and try again and it will work. \n\nI think its a great idea but hopefully it will be able to work with the app in the background instead.\n\nTo all the negative nancys out there, yes there are bugs and yes the app is not perfect but its a start and a good idea in the very least. If you are socially responsible enough, you wouldnt mind keeping if in power save mode in the background. \n\nPersonally, I will listen to music during commute so I will play it in the background while keeping this app on in the foreground. I only use it when i’m in public spaces with crowds so its not a big deal if it has to be on in the foreground for a while to work. If u label this as a useless/lousy app just because you rather watch videos/ scroll through social media than keep this on in the foreground, maybe it just shows what you prioritise as a person.	1
2898	Good	0
2899	Easy and for a great cause. Does exactly what we need it to do.	0
2900	Not sure if it has been mentioned. But do allow setting to allow off bluetooth upon connecting to certain wifi or certain timing. I.e at home or when sleeping as it doesnt make sense to be running at these timings.	1
2901	So far it isn't doing me any good. I got a warning saying about a risky encounter. And it's been months since I don't go outside. So it is simply not possible I spent 15 minutes less than 2m close to somebody. So, probably a neighbor. So what? Do I get tested? I don't need an app to tell me to contact my doctor if I experience any symptom. Unless all those notified get tested after the "risky encounter", I don't see much the point of the app.	1
2902	I bought a new phone and I now have it but I don't have the 6 digit code im very happy to have my covid tracing I get information from not just Ireland but all over the world	0

2934	great initiative to help each other with this app, however disagree with the idea of putting the phone face down whereby the phone is the most dirty. yes i understand, it is one of the ways to save battery on iPhone as it closes/dims the phone screen. hmm... i hope developers can assist or find another way to keep this running in the background without users putting phones facing it down on tables or surfaces. a big thank you for all the efforts!	0

2946	Battery drain issues appear to be fixed, but I'm afraid the damage has already been done...

Really hope this doesn't happen again...	1
2947	Don't exactly know if it works since I am not able to see my tracing data. Latest update gets too much personal data, why does this app need NRIC? Almost all apps have stored using nric. Also the recent update for safe entry needs more functionality to be fully effective, I am able to get my individual bar code to show a scanner at the mall, but am not able to qr scan for signs in parks, etc.	1

2964	Cant even validate nric properly and expecting usage from population. Did the government not even understand the basic principles of releasing a software application? Called bug testing?	1
2965	All good and then it works w/ Apple tracing too. BUT my iPhone crashed & I setup all from scratch using iCloud BUT the app doesn’t save to iCloud. So all the tracking on iPhone since app launch have gone down the toilet. Totally not good. Hope I don’t get sick for I don’t keep diary for this app does it or should have	1

2973	Good job	0
2974	Works well, does what it says on the label. I have my phones gps turned off and COVIDSafe still works so it does not care about your location and does no even ask for access. Easy to setup. Negligible battery usage does not even show in my top 10 battery users. A+++	0

2977	Great app to keep an eye on you're health.	0
2978	Good	0
2979	I can use the app normally for now	1
2980	The pros: - It registers and automatically checks-in really quickly. - Easy-to-use UI. The cons: - Absolute battery vampire. - Interrupts Bluetooth connection to earbuds. (Goodluck yall. My music was interrupted at least 3 times while typing this review.) Please give us an update on when the disruptions will be fixed. I'm actually contemplating downloading a shady QR scanner over this. (Oops it cut my earbud connection again.)	1
2981	Great idea. Definitely needs an English interface. I understand we are in Finland but the virus can infect anyone not to mention, tool can be very useful for tourists or other visitors just the same.	0

2986	I think it'd be great if ye could develop a push notification, that way once a day we can all be reminded to check in	1
2987	(previously a 5 star review - now changed to 1 star) The app says it's working, but in the notification bar is says "COVIDSafe is not active" - and no matter what settings, permissions or restarting - it won't change. No longer sure if it's keeping me safe from COVID-19 !	1
2988	Getting error in issuing permit after recent update and facing login problem getting error at the time of login.	1
2989	Dear Sir, Can I ask how to solve the problem on " this app is not available in your country." This person is holding a local data plan, malaysia phone. Kindly advise.	1

2996	The battery drain is way over the top. I thought it was just the dact you need the GPS and Bluetooth on. However I turn those off when I'm at home and still it drains my battery!	1
2997	It was a good experiance to be updated with the situation about Corona in entire country.	0
2998	Hi, I can't update my profile details when Im trying to input my FIN particulars. I have already tried to uninstall and reinstalled the app, but the issue still the same.	1
2999	This is worst app Always asking to on location and bluetooth.why if its have any ability then bydefault its show the condition of area without any location and bluetooth sharing.	1
3000	Since installing the app, my phone has had issues when I call people. It usually takes 2 or 3 goes before I can get through or it doesn't hang up randomly. Since removing the app my calls have gone straight through.	1

3009	It was working fine but after I uninstalled and reinstalled this (v2.4.1), I am stuck at creating profile, it cannot proceed at all. all entry were correct but it always prompt "sorry, were temporary unavailable. please try again later"	1
3010	Unable to fully install cos my NRIC was stated invalid. Help needed. On the page when you input your particular eg. Name, phone no. , nric no. , nric date of issue. The column to input NRIC NO. keeps reflecting invalid NRIC NO.. I am unable to proceed further. Uninstall and reinstall also no different.	1
3011	When registering using Visa number it further goes registration process after which it says " error requesting OTP.try again ". But even after deleting the app and did a fresh installation it is same. Hopes the technical team will soon elaborate this bug.	1
3012	50 notifications of the same spot and time. not even in the city I live in. Could have been useful if it actually worked.	1
3013	Everyone should have it installed and turned on	0
3014	good	0
3015	I am so grateful to the developers of this app and to Health Canada for implementing it. \nOne suggestion would be that the app be compatible with the Apple Watch. \nAs a healthcare provider, I do not take my phone into the patient room. I realize that this decreases my chances of the app being accurate for my potential exposures. It would be great for providers to have their watch detecting exposure, since I expect that most, like me, do wear them in the room. \nThanks again for the innovative work!	0

3031	how can you register -- the cursor is not functioning -- it stopped when you fill out your age	1
3032	I like the idea of this app but it is buggy. First of all since installing the app my phone now gets very hot and the battery drains extremely quickly. Also the app interferes with my Bluetooth headphones and keeps interrupting it every minute or so for 5 to 10 seconds. That is very annoying. The bugs need to be ironed out.	0
3033	Everyone go and install this app now! This app is extremely useful in this current situation :) Good job GovTech for coming up with this app! Let's all combat COVID-19 together!!	0
3034	Found to be very useful	1

3041	Awesome	0
3042	The app is much more user friendly and relative	0
3043	This app is so lousy. Cannot be installed on Huawei phones and androids of older OS. It also must be connected to wifi or mobile data. It also cannot use the QR scanner as an independent entity for SafeEntry, so without internet access this app is useless. Should have more languages too.	1
3044	Received code from SMS is not accepted by the app.	1
3045	I can't get code why	1
3046	20/3 tip: the OTP always doesnt work on the first try. Hard close the app and try again and it will work. \n\nI think its a great idea but hopefully it will be able to work with the app in the background instead.\n\nTo all the negative nancys out there, yes there are bugs and yes the app is not perfect but its a start and a good idea in the very least. If you are socially responsible enough, you wouldnt mind keeping if in power save mode in the background. \n\nPersonally, I will listen to music during commute so I will play it in the background while keeping this app on in the foreground. I only use it when i’m in public spaces with crowds so its not a big deal if it has to be on in the foreground for a while to work. If u label this as a useless/lousy app just because you rather watch videos/ scroll through social media than keep this on in the foreground, maybe it just shows what you prioritise as a person.	1

3059	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0

3065	Using Samsung S9 and finding very big battery drain issues (way more than the phone's reported daily battery use stats) and itnerference with Bluetooth speakers. I'm all for helping to contain the virus, but these issues will prevent a lot of people from downloading the app. I hope developers are tinkering with updates to fix these issues. My wife has a Samsung S10 and finding even worse issues with battery. With many millions of downloads, the app in its current version is bound to cause someone somewhere to have a phone run dead when they need to make an emergency call or something like that.	1

It ask me register again but when i do so i get the otp i enter it but then it says API KEY NOT AVAIALBLE. I also contacted the customer service for this and they assured me that the technical team will contact me for the same and resolve my problem. But since then i havnt heard from them. I am not able to go out due to this to even buy my food and basic needs.	1

Can someone help me plz koz i need to go at least to supermarket	1
3106	I'm all for this app, but it keeps turning off itself. Not sure if it is the issue with this new version or my new phone, but I couldn't figure out how to keep it running constantly.	1
3107	Still not 100% sure it is the app or just a huge coincidence. Ever since I have installed the app, my Bluetooth in the car gets momentarily disconnected. While it does reconnect, it is a real issue as it invariably happens during a call. If it keeps happening, I will uninstall and see if things improve.	1

3110	Not sure that it works, I was at Wijnegem shopping centre the other day (a Saturday) and it was packed with people. I would be very surprised if no-one there raised an alert on my phone. I guess more people need to download & use it? But even then...	1

3125	The checkin process has been greatly sped up. A few pointers though, after the Nov. patch (5th of the month i think) the UI felt like a downgrade from the previous one. 1) Having the menu display everything is better than the current sideway sliding menu. 2) I see no reason to display the patient name; with the counter, it's taking half the screen. But all in all, not bad ??	0
3126	Battery drain is too heavy and I cannot afford to have my phone sacrifice significant battery life	1

I know its being recorded than why not show as well. In addition the app should be able to automatically turn on bluetooth/wifi once permissions are given. Not sure why you keep asking the user every single time	1
3150	The app keeps stopping as soon as I open it. When I uninstalled and reinstalled, it worked for a day before it stopped working again. All the permissions are allowed, I've turned off battery optimisation, still nothing. For me it's completely non-functional.	1

Also, if it makes a difference to loading app, the + 61 will confuse those who haven\u2019t travelled overseas previously which could delay / stop sign ups.

I have been tested for the covid 19 two days back and waiting for the app to get opened for the result... Tried many times... pls do recommend me some other way to get my covid 19 test result...	1

3220	Good	0
3221	Just a Tip on saving battery life , pls ON ur Bluetooth only when ur outside/ commuting . U don't need this app to be working when ur home.	1
3222	Good idea...but it’s destined to be ineffective. To get an alert, an infected person needs to not only register, but has to be wandering around close by while infected when he/she should be in quarantine. If the infected person is within range for me to get an alert it’s going to be after they are healthy again (more than likely). So how is this app supposed to help?	1

3228	Disappointed in the typo-ridden form response to feedback. Simply acknowledge the exact complaint from the user! Poor performance in the dark. Singpass mobile seems to turn on night mode or smth. TraceTogether just gives darkness. resulting in a frustrated user and security guard. No, the govt isn't going to harvest your data with Bluetooth beacons all over the island. Yes, TraceTogether can access sensitive information on where you check in, like counselling services.	1
3229	The most laggy app by far! Only using because it's my civic duty. But seriously, a well funded government should employ a better team to produce a better app.	1
3230	Good	0
3231	Good app.	0
3232	Very simple to install. Just remember NOT to use the starting 0 when you enter your phone number because of the +61 format in the registration process and finally make sure you have Bluetooth ON so it keeps running in the background.	0

3255	Not able to scan always error on no internet connection	1
3256	Destroys bluetooth usability. Causes frequent cut outs and drops of Bluetooth when near another device with the app running. I didn't want to remove it, but the safety hazard from it interfering with my hands free meant it had to go.	1
3257	More essential	0
3258	Very baad baad	1
3259	Good	0
3260	The app does not track your location. It keeps a log of all the phones you have been near for last 21 days. It does not upload this information unless you give the permission; and you are only asked to do so in the event someone you had contact with is infected. When you uninstall the app, all the data on your phone are deleted. As restrictions ease, clusters of outbreaks will happen. Effective contact tracing is the only way to localise these clusters. Otherwise, everyone get locked down again.	1
3261	This is very sadly premitive app not Many options or benefits, i find it useless specially it is in Turkish only	1
3262	well and good contact tracing forbthis covid19 pandemic disease virus. Fight fight fight foreout and vanished out covid19.. we will flushed you in the lavatory and in water closet for you to drain and flushed out going to stay at septic tank where germs are all intack and implace.. byee byer covit19.	0
3263	Terrible app besides draining battery 3 times the rate, it interferes with fitness app synckng with your fitness tracker. Rendering all your fitness tracking app useless. To assist tracing you have to give up the base functions of what you use your phone for.	1

3280	I changed my phone a week before now in my new phone i cannot register the app. Everytime i tried to do register with NIRC the app shows we are temporarily unavailable..! \ud83d\ude14	1
3281	Great initiative. Just a note to those that don't understand how this works. This app is based on proximity. It does not track or know your location. All it knows is if you've come close to someone with COVID-19. Imagine walking blindly around town but having to raise a flag if you encounter someone wearing perfume. This is how this app works. You don't know where you are, or who is wearing the perfume, you are just made aware that you were close to someone wearing perfume.	0
3282	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0

3285	I haven't an experience to use it yet, but it looks cool. This is useless apps ever.. did not give you any information. Cmon guy make it better like others.

3286	Drains phone battery so fast	1
3287	3 Jun, it was reported in ST that this app doesn’t work well on iOS and SNDGG doesn’t have any plan to use Apple and Google’s API. I wonder why?\nfurthermore, why NRIC issue date is required!?Too much private info needed for something that don’t work well. How secure is the app and the backend against hacking and data leaks that might happen in the future?	1
3288	I think this app is interfering with my POSB app. After installing TT my POSB app keep hanging or blanking out.	1

3309	Vary much informative	0
3310	You need to enable the location or the app does not work! This means that you can't use the app and prevent other apps or Google to track your precise locations. It may be true that the app does not use the locations, but the only way to have it working is allowing all the other apps and Google to track your locations. This is a grave loophole. I normally don't want apps to track me all the time, so I can't use this app. Please,inform user correctly!	1
3311	Causes my Bluetooth earphones to constantly drop out . Took me a while to find the root cause of it man. Thought my earphones was faulty! Bad bad bad	1
3312	UAE advised (As per gulf news)us to download this app to find out our COVID-19 test result, (i have tested from ph screening centre Abudhabi ) on 29th april2020 which is still showing NOT TESTED. May be it is for specific hospital use not for everywhere uae.	1
3313	Useless app..	1
3314	Nice	0
3315	This app was a great idea, but could have done with some more background work before launching. It has been responsible for so many people's phones crashing. So everyone keep away from this app. Unless you have plenty of money to spend on getting a new phone or phone repaired. It also lacks information on daily new cases and county break down.	1
3316	I've tried to sign up but NOT receiving any OTP after few attempts. Giving up.	1

3319	I installed this app immediately after seeing the ads that tells me to. It's so sad to see that only a handful number of people have this app installed in their phone and it has been a long time since this app was announced. People are coming up with all sorts of excuses to not installed this app and make it seem like this app is harmful when it is in fact helpful.	1
3320	Easy to set up	0
3321	This keeps us safe, and the rating isn't about downloading the app. Rather, this apps negatively affects your phones functioning. 1) battery is drained at an insane pace!!! Full battery gone by noon (S10). 2) Bluetooth device disruption, both my buds and my UE Boom drop out often. Since uninstalling the app, both of these functions have returned to normal.	1

3337	I received a message from this app, that i was one of the selected to test the app. So here it is. sign up was easy. I have an active work permit with MOI stamp, permit is valid from sunday to saturday, 5am to 11pm. I am working in jubail and my home is in khobar. The issue is, in this app it is showing that I am not permitted to travel. What seems to be the problem? By the way, I am a Nurse.	1

3347	Recently updated the app, and it uses up the battery very quickly. Battery drained up so fast that I had to uninstall app. Not worth keeping app on if it uses battery that quickly.	1
3348	Each and every place in Doha requires this app to let people to enter, but people who are in Doha with tourist visa can not sign up themselves in this app. This is ridiculous!! Hope this app will be updated for tourists ASAP.	1
3349	Despite countless feedback about battery consumption since it's inception, nothing has been done to address this problem. Stop wasting people's time by asking for details of our phone's firmware as I do not see anyone addressing the issue of battery drainage till now. Huge disappointment in this programme as well as wasting tax payers money paying for it as problems unsolved for months. If it's not ready, do not force the people into a corner to make it mandatory.	1

3351	I can't open mine, it's only questionmark I already uninstalled and install it again but still desame always questionmark. Can someone pls tell me why?	1
3352	Had no issues with this app EXCEPT that only 25% of the population uses it so what is the point. Probably should have been pushed out to all active mobiles by the Govt, like bushfire warning and the like. Have now uninstalled it as do not come into contact with many people these days and my location has no active cases.	1
3353	Useless. Doesn't do anything to help against covid 19	1
3354	You have to have a mobile phone number. Not all of us use mobiles, just everyone, especially any organisation, has that expectation.

Lately it seem that it only captured maybe those arround must be longer than( number of minutes instead of of just passby). It registered lesser in number instead of in hundreds.	1

3446	This app interfere with my Bluetooth earbuds! My earbuds keeps getting disconnected after some time when I turn on trace together app but when I turn off, everything works.

3449	This app is a great effort but the radius alert is incorrect. It does not show the actual location of ppl affected with Corona. The effectiveness of this app was to check that safety radius around you, only if it shows all the affected persons in the area.

3473	Does anyone know if you need to have the app open in the background at all times or does it work constantly just by virtue of having it downloaded on my phone??? I only gave 3 ?? for this reason	0
3474	Good app	0

3479	Most lousy app I ever see. Bluetooth running in background is drain my battery fast. Erase immediately after I install it. It suck!	1
3480	A few days ago, this app started draining my battery. I was out on the Bay when I noticed my phone shut down. Had I gotten into trouble out there, I would have been unable to call for assistance. I couldn't shut off the app so I had to uninstall it. Please let us know when this is fixed. I tried to write a second review but I can only edit my first one. I reinstalled the app after I learned that the problem was fixed. Except now I can't use the Covid check-in feature because I had to re-input my profile yet it won't let me confirm changes to my profile. The button just doesn't work. Aaaargh!	1
3481	Great app thank you	0
3482	If all singaporean need to download, it should be userable to all brand of phone.. Like HW and ios.	1
3483	It was great and very handy but last night I got a notification that an app was draining my battery and when I clicked on the notification it told me that it was this app. Since then my phone's battery is literally dying. I don't want to uninstall because of what it does but why have it if my phone is going to turn off anytime I leave the house or have to constantly charge my phone. Is this just my phone or has this got something to do with the app? Never happened before for any app	1

3500	Good One but If A person doesn’t register it then it has no value so i am requesting government to Register all by going everyones house and giving them ID And pass then it will be actually worthy. Hope this will be done as soon as possible. If wait for a person to come in hospital and then you will register him or her then it will be too late as many of us try to hide it as we are not habituates in living maintaining social distance and we dont know how to manage it,so	0
3501	Terrible app. Deleted before because it drained battery said they fixed it. Do i installed it again 2 days ago and all it does is drain the battery. It has updated the national breakdown in the todays I had it.	1
3502	Cannot install because my 3 year old phone is not compatible. I wonder how many of the at-risk population such as rhe older people are in the same boat, not having rhe latest and greatest phones. Not going to buy anew phone just to run this app!	1
3503	This app is annoying. Yes ive downloaded it and let it take control of my settings. Unfortunately it wants control of battery optimization. I allowed as its the only way it will turn on but it constantly turns off all day and i have to reset the battery optimization again even with a full battery it does this. Whats the point of it if it keeps turning off	1

3521	It deactivated itself on 1st day: I can't reactivate & will just uninstall. Not a single positive review: tells it all.	1
3522	I don’t know what is it for?	1
3523	Just download the app... due to mandatory soon. Unfortunately stuck at the OTP. If thd App is not ready for the public it should not be implemented island wide. I'm wling to support the trace togetacticity but your app really not ready for the whole public. Please look into it immediately.	1
3524	Make this app for rooted device also, those who have rooted will get superuser permission, and tell them to grant superuser access.	1

3529	Fully frustrating app. No information about to test online. Just wast of time for me.	1
3530	Better than the last anti covid app. But kept deactivating until I cleared the cache and app data. I guess something from the old app was causing the bug. It's worked for several days now without bugging.	0
3531	Dafuq! Why Singpass cannot use anymore? Garment app kena compromised?	1
3532	A breakdown in numbers per town would sharpen attention. The app is more like a screenshot of a Web page - nothing very illuminating. How often has the contact tracing element been used? Battery draining was a real problem. Reinstalled now. Let's see.	1

3593	TraceTogether definitely has a faster reaction time when scanning the QR code. Using it has been fuss free and the favourite tab is extremely conveniently for highly frequent places. It would be great if we are also able to find the list of places near us (similar to Singpass app) for check in so that we are not dependent on finding and scanning the QR code.	0

3612	Bluetooth always on resulting battery drain	1
3613	Good intentions but the given reason it wants Location Permissions is not true - as far back as June 2019 Google has already told developers you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a (Bluetooth) scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	1
3614	UI is very good, very simple. Privacy definitely ok. The key will be how will Bluetooth works across devices, and I guess we won't know that until we see 3-4 million downloads and a few alerts happening	0

3624	Recently started to require all sorts of additional information (and phone permissions), with no good reason why stated.

3755	Necessary App to keep searching for data from point to point. Ultimately arriving at a point where collected.	0
3756	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
3757	Not much useful information	1
3758	What is the daily update of this application? It's good because the content is always updated, but it's a waste of data if the application is always everyday needed to update.. Hopefully 2-3 weeks before you update your application..	0
3759	This should be given a negative star. The first day after installation, it drained my phone battery from full charge to less than 10 percent overnight when I slept, note that it wasn't even launched and actively running. I have uninstalled it, despite being forced to download it in the first place.	1

3774	Had the same battery issue but Clearing Storage in Google Play Services, rebooting the phone and the enabling Contact Tracing in the Covid19 app solves the problem. You will also have to enable Phone Backup again (if used) as this will have been disabled by clearing storage in Google Play Services. Hope this helps. Battery drain for a few days is better than lockdown for weeks.	1

3794	The app has a serious problem. I had gone to visit the ministry of health and the Etheraz app had a (?) Question mark. I tired to re install the app 3 times to check if that would work and I tried calling the hotline number for assitance twice around 11:30am. An automated response says that there are 10 customers waiting and that an agent will get back to you in 2 hours. It has been more than 9 hours and i have still not received a call back. The issue is still not sorted and a bit frustrating.	1
3795	I don't have a qatar sim. But my family members are using it .really useful	1
3796	Seems to have turned on flight mode on my Galaxy S20 Ultra when it has had a "handshake" with another phone with the app. This has happened twice and both times I was within bluetooth range of another phone. Having been in self imposed isolation, these two are the only occasions that I have been within bluetooth range of another phone for 15 minutes or more. Since the flightmode icon is so small, I didn't realise it was on for some time which was very problematic.	1

3814	I installed the app, it was easy to install and seems working OK but since the app doesn\u2019t give live feedback to the user due to the privacy of other users, there is no practical way to know if it is working as it should be.   My main concern and suggestion is that it only works on the phone and not on the watch. Phones are not easy to sanitise each time you go out and come back that is why, whenever I go grocery shopping i only have my Apple Watch with me since I can have my calls, texts and payments with it and I can wash it while washing my hands when I come home. Therefore my phone shows no contact with anyone.	0

I usually charge my phone first thing in the morning, about 7am. Previously, the battery level will drop to about 60% by 6pm. But with this app, the battery level is at 60% by noon!	1

3913	Great app. Works well. It does use a little bit more battery but that was to be expected especially with older phones. To the people complaining about GPS, this app is completely open source, you can take a look and assure yourself that GPS is nowhere used. The location permission is a shortcoming of the android API. If you don't trust the app from the playstore, compile and install it yourself. Or root your phone and then disable GPS completely.	0
3914	Very clear	0
3915	Nearly 24 hours after its release and it failed in the registration process. Keeps saying my mobile number is invalid	1
3916	App almost unusable anymore. Since one week, the app consumption has gone from 2-3% to around 30% of the battery, leading to an early shutdown of the device which therefore isn't tracing anymore. And if we want to save the battery then we have to stop the app which, of course, stop the tracing either. Early user of this app, I'm really convinced of its value, so it's really sad that developers have made a version which will have a negative impact on the contact tracing overall. EDIT : @Government Technology Agency : I had reached out to your support center before, but as per your comment, I've just sent an email to your services with all detailed infos.	1

3955	Needs to be available in foreign app stores. I have this app installed and I have no complaints. I don't know whether it works but it has been unobtrusive. However I note that this was (and maybe still is) available only in the Swiss app store. Some apps, most notably WhatsApp, bind identities to telephone numbers and as a result people who move to Switzerland or who spend a lot of time here but live abroad often do not change their telephone number and are still tied to e.g. the French Google app store. Native Swiss are unlikely to have this problem, so this does not explain the limited uptake of the app, but it does contribute to the limited uptake. I would also argue that international jet-setters are relatively high risk and so are people for whom the app is most likely to yield useful effects. If the app is still restricted to the Swiss google app store, please free it.	0
3956	Are there numbers available to let us know how many people are using that app? So that we know, that the purpose of this app uses its full potential ,otherwise I'm just going to uninstall it again since it's using so much battery power.	1

4002	Good Application	0
4003	I like the idea of the app, but I will have to delete it from my phone. If I start with a 100 % charge in the morning and do nothing else (and I mean that literally) the app will consume all of my battery life. This is in a situation where there has been no one around me to log any contacts. Yes, I am using an older SE with 90% capacity but at least with the Alberta app I was able to enable or disable as needed when I was going to be in contact with others. In the current state this app is unusable for me.	1

4007	Note, there are times I want to check out, but the app keeps getting hanged. Kindly resolve. Also your scanning in and out of MRT is a sad joke. We scanned in, when we arrived at our destination, we are checking out from the station we check in. Surely, for MRT station, you should have a QR code for checking out. Especially, if we are transferring from one line to another line. The link is lost, and we end up losing track of whether we checked out. Most ppl ignore the QR code check in/out.	1

4020	Dear MOI, Please confirm why you require access to literally everything on my phone? Location is one thing but the ability to change apps? Access storage? There are privacy issues here and this needs to be addressed before I install this app. Thank you	1
4021	Nice information providing	0
4022	Easy to use. I don't really like having that notification there all the time though, so got rid of that.	0

4028	Waste of space. Kills battery and requires so much information that invades user's privacy.	1
4029	Nice	0
4030	Sits on 97 percent install bloody hopeless	1
4031	Had the app for a while but only just recently uninstalled due to all of a sudden high battery usage.	1
4032	I still get an SMS telling me to install it every day even though I did. And developers, I understand it takes time to translate it, but will you simply allow people to take screenshots? Then at least we can use Google translate to scan the text. Anyway I'm a copywriter in quarantine with COVID, so get in touch with me, I'll translate it for free.	1
4033	Good	0
4034	Good app	0
4035	Can't register and got the OTP code	1
4036	The app puts a fixed SAFE bar at bottom of screen. The bar obstructs usage of other apps.. Eg. NEXT or OK button... Though I think it is an important app but I had to uninstall.	1
4037	Good	0
4038	Cool	0
4039	Just found out this has a bug that is effecting my pull down notification screen that prevents displaying all the notifications text. Brand new motorola G8 plus with all updates. The lower part of notification text is cropped. Have to uninstall this and wait for update as too frustrating. Before this 5 stars for the app. Update: Can resolve the problem by turning off the Covid app notification permission or other option is go back to v1.0.28 APK but can do via the play store.	1
4040	After I update I have to do registration all over . Waste of time	1
4041	I cannot open it anymore.. Why	1
4042	Good	0
4043	This app was draining my battery and overloading my phones system. My phone also became exceptionally hot, so hot I thought it might possibly catch fire. I would reinstall it if this problem experienced by thousands of ex-users is resolved. Everything returned to normal as soon as I uninstalled it.	1
4044	Ok if you're a foreigner with foreigner I'd and you can't take a hold of your HES code (because of errors and such) by entering e-devlet you can reach your HES code	1
4045	full of errors, cannot accept my name and nric	1
4046	Not signing in	1
4047	Good	0
4048	The app serves its purpose however given the link to Bluetooth is it creating no end of Bluetooth connectivity issues resulting in the dropping put of other bluetooth connected devices (headphones, Android auto, etc)	0
4049	This app is power hungry and when everyone is under circuit breaker there is not much contact to trace anyway.	1
4050	Thanks for the update.	0
4051	Stupid only allow this to scan in! I take my token for F now?	1
4052	Your app developers don't know what "favourites" mean? Now everywhere I go and check in is in my favourite list. It took me a long time to find the 5 places I put in favourite now that it's infested with every damned kopitiam, provision shop and hardware shop I stepped into. Think before implementing solutions for non-existent problems!	1
4053	Easy to use and will save lives.. and that life might be yours or mine.. well done to our caring, smart government..Certainly a lot better than some other country leaders overseas...get onboard people.. Aussies are smart and we look out for each other ...	0
4054	Why its asking for access to data including pictures? And you can't enter anywhere without it so you have to install it.	1
4055	Responsible, in conjunction with Google Play Services, for huge battery drain and phone overheating issues on multiple devices over the last 24 hours. Will need to uninstall if they continue.	1
4056	My phone consistently lost all battery in a few hours. Reluctantly uninstalled app on 9/8/2020. Excellent idea for the app, useless if all phones are dead. Let the public know when Google play services have decided to correct the errors please. On a side note, my mobile now is not receiving any calls. All going straight to message. Strange.	1
4057	Fine	0
4058	Good	0
4059	Not a friendly user app	1
4060	This is my work phone not my personal phone but is too old to download app so I'm not happy.	1
4061	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
4062	Protected app	0
4063	Data privacy should not be a concern with the app, it works well, but the battery drain is crazy.	1
4064	It works	0
4065	This is the second time using this apps, I have been using it without any problem before but I uninstalled it after I got my token. However when I download it again today, I could not even get the OTP, it kept on saying I have internet connection issue while I have none. Disappointed	1
4066	Indeed very usefull. Snappy salute to all brilliant minds behind this awesome app.	0
4067	It says temporarily unavailable, try again later and it has been like that for 2 days already!!! When is it going to be fixed? I cannot check in to stores using phone and I have not collected the tracetogether token as it's not available in my region yet! And we also cannot help others to check in!!! So how?	1
4068	General feedback: Singpass app has work well for Safe Entry. Will be great if TraceTogether can mirror it. Switching to TT only cos govt wants more to use TT but its interface has much room for improvement	0

4080	Good	0
4081	App is draining the battery more than it did before	1
4082	Very happy	0
4083	As soon as I've finished this review I will be deleting this app. (*Edit I reinstalled app cos I felt to guilty even if others are d-bags) The whole point of this app is to protect others as a community, well the Australian community has made it clear it doesn't care. As a disabled person I am once again highly impacted by the hording that the rest of the "community" has been doing. Today on a pointless trip to the supermarket i noticed only ONE other person wearing a mask (Victoria).	1
4084	Very Helpful application.?	0
4085	You say this app does not use GPS. Then why does it need location permission to operate? Remove it before I report it to Google to get this banned	1
4086	This app has serious Bluetooth connection issue. It interferes other Bluetooth devices and make them not working properly, such as to ear phones. It's very annoying and so inconvenient. I must kill this app in order my other Bluetooth devices can work properly. Already many complaints about this. Fix this. No need to reply back this review by asking email to your support, OS version, screen captures and such things. Please take seriously before forcing people to use this.	1

4115	Battery draining is a big issue with new version.	1
4116	A few hrs after i have installed this, my phone started to reboot itself and i cant even get through it. Tried fast boot, to be able to turn on my phone. Then it happened again. Once i got my phone to boot, i uninstalled this app and did not have the issue again. Im using MUI 11.0.10.0 hope someone can help me with this.	1

4136	Satisfied	0
4137	It seems they have fixed the interruptions to Bluetooth and I am happy to use it again. Terrible interruptions to any Bluetooth stream. I can not listen to music without this app stopping the stream for 10 seconds or more. Tried to stop app while using my phone for music but it comes back on. I would have to uninstall and reinstall when interacting with people to tolerate it. Not worth it while SA is covid-19 free. I have uninstalled it until I hear that the Bluetooth is fixed.	0

4140	Massive battery drain on my new Galaxy S10 5G. Uninstalled, battery usage back to normal (had it installed for a week or so prior to the 5 Nov update with no issues, battery issues began after that update).	1
4141	Unreliable app. Keep crashing even with Bluetooth and gps turned on. Using Pixel 2 XL in Android 11	1
4142	Ok	0
4143	Good	0
4144	Battery consumption to much	1
4145	otherwise pretty good but the app disturbs the connection with bluetooth headphones somewhat. spotify stops playing consistently if the phone is placed in a pocket and doesnt start again until i open the spotify app to check why the music stopped. also needs a language selection for at least english.	0
4146	Everything works well with the app for contact tracing but having the option to put when you got to a place AND when you left would be good and people would probably be more likely to keep trace of that rather than putting it in the details section.	0

4318	Don't understand why the app required me to input issue date of NRIC, which meant having to search for the physical card. If you want people to use the app, only collect necessary info for contact tracing. Minimize the steps users must go through for a higher sign up/retention rate.	1

4384	One star due to lack of transparency. Will you be providing the companion software/app to the LGUs to scan the QRs of users from this app? 'Cause, in order to receive goods or financial aids from the Govt., the citizen will be required of their true identity (Full Name, Birthdate, Address) which is necessary for liquidation. This is opposite to what you are telling the public. That you are not collecting real data. This is MISLEADING.	1

4392	Zero bluetooth exchanges ever since update! Stop asking users to write in to the email or try with family members! We have tried and found the problem to persists regardless what we do. Reinstallation means losing ALL records! Do not do so if you are at risk of exposure!	1

4463	Since recent "update" this app is no longer giving up-to-date information about the number of covid-19 cases per county (info has not been updated since 30 August) Also, there is no longer a total of cases per county. Instead there is VERY confusing (and INACCURATE) information re the number of cases in past fortnight, the number of cases of cases "today" (30 August) while on another page there is a list of total HOSPITALIZED patients only. Of course this does NOT reflect total no. DIAGNOSED.	1
4464	Good app	0
4465	Can you please remove the persistent/constant notification panel alert? I do not want to disable notifications in case this will interfere with possible COVID interaction notifications. When I press the persistent notification it says "We Wish You A Lot of Health" "Foreground Service Channel" Then gives the option to disable notifications. Please advise if this will interfere with the ability to receive alerts for overlap notifications.	1

4496	From 19/12/20 CPU usage of this app has skyrocketed to over 20% of my mobile phone battery daily usage. My Phone is a Samsung S9 with Android 10 latest patch. I now have to recharge my smartphone twice a day. See below usage values for the CovidSafe App. on 21/12/20 11.1%, on 20/12/20 20.3%, on 19/12/20 5.8%, on 18/12/20 1.1%, on 17/12/20 1.2%, on 16/12/20 1.4%, on 15/12/20 1.2%. The app appears to have a virus worm that flattens battery in devices. I've had the app for more than 6 months and this has never happened in the past. I'm trying to contact technical support but my hold time is 40 minutes. I'm stating just the facts and expressing no angry emotions I'm feeling right now!	1
4497	I like how it doesn't assume you have (or want) internet access and geolocation turned on, and I can keep those turned off to maximise privacy from every other (often uninstallable) personal data hungry app on the phone.	1

4514	Good app to have but need to make sure your settings don't close it down. Just checked my battery usage from it not sure if it is from an update but some how it has used the most battery of any app on my phone... in 20hr standby had used 32% of battery (s20+) double of any other app. Worse so far today in 26% in 12hr. No wonder i have to keep charging now.	1

Not working! *Update - Restart handphone now working fine. Have to keep monitoring the exchange detection to determine if the software is running correctly... Hope the software updates can eventually resolve this.	1
4523	This app is sus at best. The Australian government knows all owe location data from the phone companies. What's the real reason this app is wanted I know people are being prosecuted for breaking the law using this app data. Don't we pay enough tax already! Also once installed it tried to upload all my contacts and other data to a US server..	1

4527	While i have no issues with operations of the app i think 15 min of Bluetooth between contacts is far too long. 5 min more appropriate. As far as i know no tracing has been found by this app.	1

4566	NOTE to those experiencing battery drain, you can FIX this by a) installing this app, b) clearing Google Play Services cache, c) restarting your phone, then d) reinstalling this app. Over the last few days my phone battery was getting slaughtered just like everyone else's; after completing these steps, this app is back to using a fraction of a percent	1
4567	Badly organized, unadjustable, and full of politics,i erased it	1
4568	Unfortunately, Not working with me	1
4569	Great idea but drains my battery	1
4570	It's good	0
4571	It's secure and uses almost no battery. I have used this over 2 weeks and it has just used 0.2% of my battery, also it's more secure then the one from my home country. Overall I'm very impressed and I would hope everyone in Ireland would use this	0
4572	The app is very informative and user friendly. The best part is it was from a company here in the Philippines. Great job!	0

4584	Americans are incredibly dumb and this app proves why. Seriously, you all are complaining because the app drains your battery? God forbid you have to get up and go get your charger, right? Be thankful you have the technology to detect cases around you. You people are stupid.	1

4590	Contact Tracing cost should be fully borne to the Singapore Govt and not to residents and tourists.Its a Medical Issue to play safe be it a resident or a visitor.When requested to install and is done so,the system must show as Installed Already to the viewer on the spot.The TT subject is very vague at this point and not easily understood by everyone.It must come as an icon on the handphone so that by touching it must show whether the place you had visited is safe.Simple as as whatsapp message.	1

4626	Really v bad experience with this app! Have been trying to uninstalled the app then install again & again several times to fill up my particulars but it seems the app continues to have problem with my phone. When i emailed to their support, no one is knowledgeable to attend to my queries and left me in silence and unattended. There isnt any other live chat or verbal contact which can be contacted with.	1
4627	I am not found this in my playstore.how can get & install this app?	1
4628	Drains battery. Please give option to only activate and use Bluetooth if you're away from the house.	1
4629	Just discovered the app had been "Auto Disabled" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).	1
4630	Works pretty well. Would prefer it if the symbol would go away from the top of the phone. Type A's hate that. Considering deleting it to get rid of the icon.	0
4631	I've noticed the same issues too with my music too. Spotify was cutting out on my car speakers. I have updated the app today, so let's see if this fixes the issues. Apart from this the App has had no other faults with me.	1

Given that if I'd like to sign up for it on a weekend there wouldn't be anyone to answer my query would there? I also can't sign up using my singpass. Unnecessary information collected as well. Terribly implemented app made "mandatory but not compulsory" with no user experience in mind. First time I've gone out of my way to review an app, and it's a ZERO star review to tracetogethe	1

4768	great initiative to help each other with this app, however disagree with the idea of putting the phone face down whereby the phone is the most dirty. yes i understand, it is one of the ways to save battery on iPhone as it closes/dims the phone screen. hmm... i hope developers can assist or find another way to keep this running in the background without users putting phones facing it down on tables or surfaces. a big thank you for all the efforts!	0

Save pre-fill details, see where I have been. I would suggest give it more of a reason to download, that way more people can be tracked.	1

Here's my cent's, the app is not that bad, it has some minor UI problem but it can still work, LIKE HOW THE APP IS DESIGN FOR. Download it and use it, if you want to help just little then do it by using this app.??	1

4812	Even though I have enabled Bluetooth, location services and notifications and turned off power saving mode as the app requested, whenever I open the app to check it is running in the background it is always disabled. It always says it's due to power saving mode being on, despite the fact I have had it off since downloading the app. Pretty sure this means the app hasn't been recording my contact with other people.	1
4813	Working fine now, keep Bluetooth on for it to work.	0
4814	The App seems to work fine but there is no way to tell if it's working. Maybe if you had a count of how many 15 minute contact you had a day you could see if it's working.	0

4817	Am having trouble registering myself (pink IC holder). Its reading my IC as invalid. Amusingly.	1
4818	Good	0
4819	Weak	1
4820	Second thought. The location issue is bad. However it's not solvable, at least for now. Unlike many here are saying it's not a permission issue. The app doesn't even ask for fine location permission. It's a design decision by google. When an app gets a list of nearby devices (wifi, bt, etc) it could use it to find the actual position of the phone. Therefore if user disables location services from the settings, listing of nearby devices (wifi, bt,..) will be disabled for all apps regardless of permission settings. As a result the covid app which is based on finding nearby and unknown devices, needs location services enabled. Mitigating factors. Try location with battery saving enabled. Disable all notification from the covid app and enable location services only when a lot of people are nearby. Also battery management is problematic. Uninstalled.	1

4825	I'm currently using Huawei P40 Pro which does not support Google mobile services. The app isn't available in the Huawei App gallery. So, I downloaded the apk file and installed it but it doesn't work and always gets stuck at the OTP. Please find a way to fix it. P40, P40 pro/pro +, Mate 30, Mate 30 pro and a number of other devices do not support Google services and hence unable to use TraceTogether. We can't just buy a new phone just for the sake of using this app. Kindly look into this.	1

4827	Had been working fine until recently, then my phone battery which would normally last for almost 2 days on one charge was drained in a matter of minutes even when not in use. I did not want to delete it but the apps not going to work if your phone is dead! This needs to be fixed ASAP and assured it won't happen again before ppl can even consider redownloading!	1

4855	Hi. I've had to remove the app as it was causing my battery to run down and heat up. Only happened recently after I applied an update to my phone OS from Samsung. Am going to try and reinstall to see if it will work again, but not a happy bunny... ??	1
4856	Very good app ðŸ‘Œ	0

4858	Terrible. I cannot ever register with valid NRIC. It keeps saying invalid nric. I know the validation is against birth date.i have triple checked that i entered birthdate and NRIC correctly but it keeps saying invalid Unit test even failed at the simplest step	1
4859	Not too sure where to ask question. May i check, since the bluetooth are always on, will this compromise our handphone contents? As in, just like wifi, bad people can access your handphone data without you knowing... Thanks	1
4860	Nice app	0
4861	I don't mind it taking my info etc... But this app burns my phone battery even faster than the spread of the virus.	1
4862	Not a valid Singapore Phone number..... Why the hell would i use a An overseas Number on a friggin singapore app......	1
4863	Obliterates my battery even when I'm working from home and don't leave the house all day (so wouldn't expect a lot of Bluetooth handshakes going on). Also seems to interfere with Bluetooth connections to already paired devices intermittently.	1
4864	Nice	0
4865	Some ppl are like We can trace a covid patients near by us By using this app Seriously.... Please Government Educate first Not to force download anyway Other wise you may get affected by corona	1
4866	I had the app on my iPhone 8 and I have noticed that the app was draining my battery especially after last software update. As soon as my phone gets to 60% battery my phone would shut off and then needs to be plugged in again. Now my phone is back to normal after deleting the app. I would love to keep the app but I can’t due to this.	1
4867	Good app! Useful. Just one point - there is a type under "I want to Help" page. In the thirda paragraph it says "State ot territory", which should be "State or territory". Just from quality check perspective, no issues as such. Great effort by the government.	0
4868	Keep requesting access to my photos & media .. Which I don't want ... I don't mind to access my location or to call me , but not my privacy	1

4875	While it's a good idea, battery life is horrible now my phone is flat before 4pm usually 8/9pm before I need to charge my phone. My phone cuts out when using Bluetooth especially music. Sure with all the tech gurus there could be a better system.	1
4876	Random red expositions notifications come up every other day, even when I stayed alone at home for 3 days in a row. Thankfully, once I check, the notification has dissapeared and the app says everything is all right. Giving false alerts like that, and similar behaviours, makes me want to uninstall the app or disable the notifications altogether. That's really counter-productive. Other than that, and it's not so much about the app. But I had to buy a new smartphone to be able to use it properly. The concept that everybody has a good enough smartphone and can enable bluetooth all the time is not realistic.	1
4877	7 months into the pandemic and the app still doesn’t work for my area.  It’s not like I live in the Arctic circle, I live in Vancouver.  \nJust another liberal smoke screen to make people think they are doing something when ALL the work has been done by the provinces, unless you count putting the country so far into debt that my grandchildren will suffer for it.\nThe developer keeps responding “this app is national in scope.”  NO IT IS NOT.  You know why? Because it doesn’t work nationally!	1

4883	I don't know what to call this app or whatever.. I have tried several times yet it keeps telling me I can't get an OTP or something. I can't even go to the supermarket to get food items.. PATHETIC!	1

4886	- Heard this application uses battery life excessively - This appliation is still in need of an update - Have already settled the 'Data Validation Error ". For those whom are currently NSF's, they would need to input the Date of Issue from their pink Civi	1
4887	This stupid app does not work at all. I emailed and asked for help but still does not work. Apparently it would be my fault if I don't use this problematic app. Seriously guys... fix this if this is a mandatory app that you want people to use this for the Singapore's government sake.	1

4927	Don't know why it requires my mobile number or voter ID number for this simple app. Useless in my opinion.	1
4928	1 star because I'm forced to download this but for some reason still required to use safeentry and fill up declaration forms. If this doesn't reduce the forms or SafeEntry I have to fill, I don't see the point of the app. Why is DOB and IC issue date required for tracing? Is there a need to check for spoofing? Have people been registering with other IC? I see I see. So you're saying that SafeEntry is ineffective then?	1
4929	Won't stay on Stays active for only a few minutes then turns itself off	1

4944	This app works just like the government forcing you to switch on the bluetooth draining your battery when your mobile is already low bat. You will received a series prompt of death even when the app is turn off just so that they force your Bluetooth on. This is so much we can expect since they must have outsourced it to some team in India.	1

5119	Phone roasting and battery draining suoer quick... where is the fix for this. Installed the app the day it was released. Saturday 8th August received a message to say that an app was draining my battery... did I wish to put to sleep. It was the Covid tracker app. I selected yes. I have since deleted the app and attempted to clear the cache (of which there seems to be a lot?) Phone still very hot and eating the battery.	1

5124	Funny how you guys are forcing this app on people and using it as a covid-19 excuse. Maybe you should develop a decent working app without all the issues that your app is having. I'd rather get the token before I let you guys screw up my phone.	1

Guarantee not to send the data anywhere but compare it locally on user's decide against downloaded "Corona paths".	0

5175	Why does the app want me to turn on bluetooth all the time?!?! Also, the notification banner will not go! Garbage app that's just a waste of ur phone battery \ud83d\ude24	1

5177	It's draining my battery on Android. Had to turn it off. \ud83d\ude2a Might try to remember to turn it on while in public places though.	1

5186	Samsung S9 and I hardly use my phone so rarely charge. Now I need to charge it constantly. Also the app interferes with bluetooth when listening via headphone. Sorry but I tired and this is just ridiculous, whoever's built this app needs to get speak to someone who knows what they're doing. If google and facebook and our phone companies can track us without this much disruption to our devices why cant this app?	1

5205	What is this app about? Kinda spy or something?? Why the app need to access my photos and medias? And location all the time plus bluetooth??? Seriously? We are living in 21 century and government force everyone to use this app.	1

5207	I think this app helpful for us..Thank you.Stay home & save our family & save other's & and save our country.plz do not go outside.if really urgent then go.but try to not go outside.	0
5208	I'm disappointed. When I entered my info in, they constantly say that they are temporarily unavailable. I gave one star, as I feel that this shouldn't happen. If there is some maintenance going on, I feel that informing people about that will make the experience with the app better.	1
5209	Difficult to find in the PlayStore. Other than that easy to install, easy to register, compact and succinct in its messages. Would benefit from a notification to check in each day - ideally user controllable for timing and on/off. I see some complaints about battery usage - but fine for me on an S8 - 0.7% of battery usage for the full day.	0

5221	Unable to register, getting temporary unavailable error	1
5222	Useless hassle It is useless in the sense that it doesn't give the right information. For example, it says that I am safe even when there might be covid cases in the surrounding area.	1
5223	Date of birth section problem please fix this.	1
5224	Had to delete it yesterday because my battery was drained in about 2 hours. Phone won't charge fast enough to keep up with the battery drainage. Looked like an easy to use app so hopefully it can be fixed to resolve the battery drainage issue.	1
5225	Update: 14 July App force closing after update. Tried deleting cache and reinstalling, but not working Simple, nice and informational app for masses. But I have an observation/suggestion: Why 12 pm - 12 pm (that is noon)? Why not reset daily counter at 12 am (midnight) as the date starts.	1
5226	Never seems to check, always a week or so behind.	1
5227	Set up, no problem.	0
5228	Keep crashing bluetooth app (user might experience this as bluetooth app rebooting), resulting in frequent reconnections to other bluetooth devices. Fix it or you will see more pp force stop the app after checking in, defeating the purpose of contact tracing.	1
5229	This app having issue in submitting curfew fine objection. Everytime there is error coming and saying try again later. It will be good if tawakalna team can fix it.	1
5230	I can't safe entry from my app and it's already the latest version. When I tried to reach out to their support group my email was blocked by them. By using bluetooth it takes up alot of my battery it's so annoying.	1
5231	Could not complete registration as there was no way to enter the 6-digit pin number.	1
5232	After opening the app all Bluetooth devices will stop connecting. The only way to fix it is to reboot the iPhone but once you reopen the app again the devices will stop connecting again.	1

5249	Right idea, wrong execution. It will notify if there is "Close contact" - within 1.5m for 15 minutes. What about workers dealing with customers, interactions of less than 15minutes but still a strong chance of transmission. Can't see how such a lenient rule will help anyone detect their exposure to the virus...	0

5256	This system needs work and is outright dangerous now: * I did a first test (using an app code), tested negative; * had to do a second test, deleted the result, gave the new code; some time after I receive a "tested negative" result; 2 DAYS LATER I receive a phone call from my GP stating I'm in fact very positive. This is super dangerous! Either make a history of tests or fix the mislinking! Maybe state the date of when you generated the code/took the test, rather than the date of when the app last polled the results! * My housemate was positive, but the doc forgot to link the code to the test; so no-one who came into contact with him had results (I didn't get it, and I spend every day, all day with him). We tried calling the contact tracing line, but "there are no developers working during the weekend", not even 1! This should be a basic thing any contact tracer can fix. * Make a "bug report" feature?	1

5263	Keeping the Bluetooth on from morning to evening drastically affected the battery and with every update its unpredictable. I am confident on the privacy of the app what it's been claimed, but the battery drains faster in crowded areas like malls and MRTs. In an emergency if the phone is off due to low battery, who will be accountable?	1

5275	Download and set up OK. Decreased my daily battery life by almost 4 hours, uninstaller and all good! Also, tried to install on my wife's phone and no matter what we tried it kept saying "invalid phone number", did everything advised, still the same. Make it work properly and I'll put it back on!!	1

5314	The fact that it's displaying a consistent notification without an option to dismiss, is: 1. Annoying; 2. When I'll get a real notification about being exposed to a sick person, I won't bother checking what's in the notification, because I always ignore the app notifications as they are redundant.	1

I was eventually able to enter it in the app via the profile page, but let's just say the onboarding wasn't smooth.

5370	Unable to download App. Have tried for more that 1 week now	1
5371	Unfortunately, a lot of misunderstanding among people. It's a really simple app. All you need to do is download it and let it be. It will work behind the scenes and inform you if something happens going forward. It uses Bluetooth to communicate with other mobile phones. While at home you can turn off Bluetooth and turn it on when stepping outside. It will only be effective if many people download it. So please understand the purpose of the app before making any rash decisions. Take care!!	0

5404	Good but the verification pin could have been automatically performed on Android (-1 star). Our company App puts the verification code in for you on receipt of the sms....so I would assume our government could do better. I will most probably update my review after a week.	0
5405	Crashes. Opens 1% of the time. When by chance it does open. It drains the battery big time.	1
5406	Nice nice	0
5407	Please help me understand, my other QR reader able to scan safe entry, but your inapp scanner reply that the same code is not a safe entry code? I have uninstalled, restarted phone, reinstalled, and still same error, why is this trace together app so useless?	1

5417	Given the importance of this app, that it’s intended for wide spread use, and you’ve had months to get it sorted , I’m appalled at the awful on boarding experience. It gives me zero confidence that it’ll keep my data secure	1

5424	Before upgrade three days ago I still can scan qr code at shopping but now tell me not valid qr code. Please help to fix	1
5425	Understand that location access is required but not storage and access to making calls. This app is made obligatory on all but labourers and other low budget employees do not own android phones. What about mobile data? Not everyone can afford. All reviews and comments by public should be taken into consideration before the mandate being applied and deadline to download such app was published. Good initiative but needs practical thought.	1
5426	App cannot be setup because the registration process will not accept my mobile number.	1

5431	Yes I do sprend more time on this app.i would like to know more details of the area where the virus near us.where we can avoid	0
5432	Ok	0
5433	I like the app as it is as private as it can be. Suggestions for improvements: I would like current figures rather than totals. Daily new cases and daily number of current active cases would be useful. Same for the county breakdown list. Total numbers are useless. The daily confirmed cases graph is not accurately readable. A covid check in reminder would be useful too. Another feature, that lets you enter the country of current stay would be useful as that can make sure that the app and covid warnings will work in the whole of Europe - provided that European apps work in the same way. E.g. the change of countries could be detected by the app and the user could be asked whether (s)he wants to change the country. The app can only be found by searching for "covidtracker", it can NOT be found by searching for "covid tracker". Google could have picked a better word for location - some reviewers think that it tracks the location. No, location service is needed for the bluetooth scanning only. No GPS used. Also for google: I tried to use paragraphs in the review to make my review readable. Why are they taken out?	0
5434	Worst app ever	1
5435	Brilliant idea	0
5436	Good	0
5437	Update 12/08 Oh goody, you added location tracking, eating into my battery life even further \ud83d\ude44 Would be better if it didn't chew through my battery life. Also while the 'oh no your bluetooth is off!' Warning is cute, it's annoying. Turning off my Bluetooth when at home because I prefer to only charge my phone once a day	1
5438	Good	0
5439	In Iceland, this is going to be key in winding down the restrictions put in place by Covid-19 Everyone should install it, without exception. Your data is reased every 14 days and can only be accessed with your express permission.	1
5440	Hopeless app! Can't receive the OTP!!!	1
5441	Total waste of time	1
5442	Gave me covid	1
5443	Drains your battery heaps. Had to uninstall it, as my phone wasn't lasting longer than lunch	1
5444	No option to reset personal information when registering. Tried contacting the number provided but no answer. Folks calling from international locations have been wasting money on international calling charges after spending significant time waiting for an answer. And no contact via email or an accurate number is given to contact.	1
5445	Good	0
5446	It says, update everytime i ve try to open	1
5447	Since the newest update, I have been experiencing interference with my other bluetooth devices. The connection has been affected and may even lose connection occasionally. Kindly fix this issue.	1
5448	Can you design it to allow it to be used on Huawei devices like the Singpass app worked very well with the P40 Pro but the tracetogether app doesn't	1
5449	Causes issues with Bluetooth connectiveity to other devices!	1
5450	The app should inform you that you will not be notified of close contact unless you open App. It happened recently to a friend. When she opened App she was told she had been in close contact with a confirmed case 5 days previously. She was contascted by the HSE shortly afterwards. One of my other friends tells me she receives a notification each week to confirm she has not had any close contacts. I do not receive this message. Should the app not be consistent for all users?	1

5464	After the recent updates, the bluetooth exchange count drop significantly. From typical day of over 1500 exchanges to about 300 exchanges and this happened to few of my colleagues. Those din update, still recording over 1500 exchanges. Is this normal? Some installed recently has ZERO!	1
5465	Good idea if this works and being notified if you have been possibly exposed to get checked and self isolate to help stop the spread.	0
5466	Very nice and useful	0
5467	I really hope this is used widely. I also hope that it becomes a more proactive altering service. Telling me about the locations I wish to go to rather than a retrospective alerting system. Clean design and robust app.	0
5468	On the first night within a few hours after I installed the app, it registered about 150 contacts. I was at home and did not even stepped out of my house, with just my wife and two daughters. How could I have contacted 150 people. Simply buggy!	1
5469	App keeps turning off. I'll give it some more time, but will delete it if it does not become more useful.	1
5470	Can’t you just say that you tested positive when you haven’t? You could passively just make people panic, stress out and worry. Unless I’m wrong about this, it’s a big flaw if people do this!	1
5471	Very inconvenience. Apps must be very simple. Leaving a leaving and closing. Don't us to scan again and again.	1
5472	Absolutely useless. Thanks Scott	1
5473	This app is a total waste of time. I've spent last 40mins trying to register but can't get past the identity verification. Done facial scanning & video all to no avail. This needs serious fixing.	1
5474	Good	0
5475	Hoping this helps getting us all back to normal. There will be tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy nutjobs who will tell you this will give the government all your information, wake up, they already have all your information! Do your bit and download this........please.	0
5476	This app is amazing! One time I saw a guy cough in the clinic at Yishun. Then everyone in the clinic started coughing and collapse. I use the tracer app to find out if he got the coronavirus. Then suddenly, MOH and Panadol came and revive them. This app really saved people's life.	0
5477	spotify lags and pauses intermittently when tracetogether is used. also drains battery. checkouts used to be reset by midnight, does that not happen anymore? can all check ins be seen so that checking out can be facilitated?	1
5478	It does not perform exposure checks no matter what I do. 0 checks in 14 days. I have my Bluetooth on 24/7 and have ensured the app runs in the background.	1
5479	Nice and easy to use. Stay safe	0
5480	Great!	0
5481	The app does not even open. I keep getting a message saying it keeps stopping, app info, close app and send feedback.	1
5482	Dont belive in this based on results now im thinking its just a track and trace on individuals	1
5483	I am going to uninstall this stupid app. It's taking too much battery, my phone can only last half a day. If you want this app mandatory, the you have to consume much lesser battery than now	1
5484	Do NOT download it behaves like VIRUS... It wants to use the Bluetooth and when I turn Bluetooth off my tablet (Xperia Z2) started to behave very strange. I couldn't use other apps or even couldn't listen music with Bluetooth off. After removing the program tablet gave errors and stopped working totally and unfortunately I have lost very much data because of this program.	1

5495	Again, still doesn’t work with Apple’s password manager. People have a hard enough time trusting the government, so please update the app to allow the native password manager on iOS randomly generate a password. Mainly so the conspiracy theorists can no longer latch on to the narrative that the government is “intentionally” leaving this feature out so that they can collect people’s email and passwords. Will keep waiting till the next update...	1
5496	Why does the app not work with Exposure Notification from Google and apple?	1
5497	It is not opening in all mobiles. It should be work in all mobiles.	1

5499	After downloading and setup the apps, my iPhone 11 Pro installed with IOS 13.5.1 keep feeling warm and my phone camera flash keep deactivated. \n\nSince day one, in-order to protect my phone battery, I had turn on the optimize battery charging in the battery function. After installing this trace together app my battery won’t charge more than 80% due to high temperature. \n\nAfter I deleted the app everything goes back to normal. \n\nHow are we going to support government roll out measure when your apps is giving problem.	1

5511	Batt drain seems fixed with latest update. 2 out of 35%	1
5512	It is not intrusive for my privacy. All info is locally on my phone and I have to give permission to use it. That I would do because it is more important to keep the virus at bay and save lives then my personal privacy. I do not mind giving up info on my travels if it helps to find possible infected people or let me know if I was near an infected person so I could be quarantined until it is known if I got infected or not so I will not infect others possible even if I don't get symptoms or not. It is not because I am concerned for my own life but I am concerned that I could possibly infect people in “so-called RISK groups” that some seem to think is justifiable to sacrifice because it is too costly or even too inconvenient for those not at risk. Who are these people the “so-called RISK groups” that some think are not worth saving from Covid-19 because it is too costly or inconvenient for so many and justified as dispensable because they are “mostly” elderly or with “underlying conditions”. The so-called RISK groups, sometimes referred to as the vulnerable often “LABELED” as people with "underlying conditions" and; That includes; cancer patients, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, people on various immunosuppressant medicines for various reasons such as people that have undergone organ transplant, people with BEHCET'S disease, Crohn's disease or various other common autoimmune diseases that have to take immunosuppressant medicines and people with suppressed immune system for different reasons and group that is mostly mentioned as if that JUSTIFIES not taking radical approach the elderly (senior citizens). That is the group that is mostly mentioned by decision makers as the people with "underlying conditions" .	0
5513	Triple Useless. A person with Covid-19 has to be tested positive (it's almost impossible to get tested in Japan). Then they have to use the app, register their positive status, keep their phone with them and keep the app running at all times (impractical). Finally, "contact" only counts if you're within 1 meter of such a person for at least 15 minutes at one time (an absurdly narrow definition of risk).	1

5566	*update* I have been checking the exposure check from i installed the app. At the start it was was doing lots of checks between 15-18 over the previous 14 days over the last few weeks this has dropped to one. I then checked it today and i have had no exposure checks in the last 14 days! What is the point in downloading the app if exposure checks are not being done.

5579	I do not trust the Singaporean government with my personal data, but as usual in this country, I have no choice but to surrender my right to privacy.	1
5580	why not add a function where businesses can create a QR code and as you enter you scan the code which is stored in the Covid safe database. An additional level of data collection to overcome the bluetooth issue	1
5581	The app interferes with the bluetooth connection of Samsung phones. After installing the app on my and my family members Samsung phones, it causes our bluetooth devices to drop the connection with the phones. Now we cannot connect with our devices. Please fix this. Thanks	1

5593	Excellent	0
5594	The data provided within the app isn't necessarily useful. There is a county by county breakdown, showing *total* number *since the beginning* of the pandemic. At this point these numbers provide no useful information, instead 14 day averages or five day averages, per 100K population should be shown, as these would give residents an indication of how their area is faring. In addition, the breakdown could be done on a council basis.	1

5610	Would love to do anything extra to help with tracing and controlling the spread of the virus but this app sucks the guts out of my battery and majorly interferes with other Bluetooth connections I have to my phone which are non negotiable so unfortunately I'll be uninstalling until I read these issues have been addressed. Poorly designed around such simple factors and functions, beggars belief!!	1

5612	Safety	0
5613	No privacy	1
5614	App is important and critical for Covid times providing excellent information about current and nearby location status and access to resources and assistance and tips. The App was KILLING my phone battery, using >35% of battery power of phone all the time, and beeping about Bluetooth even when BT was on. Changing the notification setting to disallow Bluetooth alerts really helped to reduce battery usage to 2-6%. Please provide information about how and when to get Covid testing.	0

5626	Doesn't give daily breakdown of new figures, can't check data by area. Eats battery and my phone is hot when the app is running.	1
5627	This app is functioning useless, as it relies on users restarting it every so often. Current community usage would be minimal at best. It should be abandoned in it's current form and the government should support citizens using the covid tracing functionality built into Android and IOS. Stop blundering along with this.	1

5642	You NEED to use the Apple/google contact tracing API. I DON\u2019t think many people realise for this to work you need to keep the app open in perpetuity. That\u2019s unrealistic. Fix this waste of taxpayer money	1

5644	Great idea, but couldn't sign up. I get an error message when I enter my phone number (Says: not a valid Singapore number). I see in the comments there are many people in my boat . No option within the app to report the problem. Please fix, I'd love to use it!	1

5659	Could use a troubleshooting section. If you are having issues with the contract tracer like I was these are the steps I took to fix it. You need to find the Google Play Services app in your settings. Give it all the permissions and clear its cache. Restart your phone. Sign your life and those of your descendents over to google. Update the Google Play Services app. Start the Covid Tracker app. Select the contact tracer. Give it the final permission it asks for and done.	1

5698	Update: Installed latest ver. Same issue. Uninstalled. Original: I've downloaded this app a few times but hv deleted it in frustration. I don't think I've deleted an app so many times b4. Other users hv mentioned abt Bluetooth connection w rgd 2 connecting to BT speakers, in my case, in the car. The music keeps stopping intermittently and once I've deleted the app, it is completely fine. Until this matter is resolved, I am looking forward to collecting my token once my cc announces e launch.	1

5710	I am getting http 403 errors almost literally every minute. So I wonder if this is going to do anything useful. I have an Android One phone, ie more pure and up-to-date version of Android does not exist. How well was this tested and how was error handling implemented ? ?? Also why does a supposedly super secure app apply http instead of Https for *any* communication? ???????	1
5711	When I enter my mobile number it says its not a valid number Edit: issue above is when you're on wifi. Turning wifi off and it works fine.	1

5731	Treasure battery juice over health safety. I am now required to charge my phone twice a day after using this app. Overall this app is okay. Hopefully developers can include covid-19 news update rather than just tracing purpose, this would my battery consumption worth.	1

5738	Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.	0
5739	I just don't understand why the application is asking for full access to photos and files on the device????	1

At the moment app is saying about 12k affected people but Radius doesn't give location of all of them , like it says in gujrat there is no patient but we know there are about 150+. Please either improve this function or remove it to avoid any misunderstanding by the commons citizen. Thanks for your patience. BR.	1

5775	Excellent safety precautionary application. Also has great future potential. However, as with most people I have to agree that the application is too heavy on the phones systems. In addition it is not required to operate on the phone all the time as only required if you are out of the house as per MOPH instructional guidelines. Finally, I do not see why the application requires access to sensitive phone data such as"media". Pleass correct these issues to have a great tool against COVID19.	0

5778	It does not accept my phone number	1
5779	Told you don't need to put in name, app demands first and last. Requires postcode for unknown reasons given it tracks you. Requires Bluetooth location data because app is locating you.

5800	Installed easily and no problems initially. One update lost the message an lost auto update. Next (manual from Play store) update needed a permission given again - it stopped working until then. Not sure if it was working with the blank message. Still wrecks bluetooth on iPhones. Badly done and rushed out the door for PR reasons.	1

5826	I own a s10 plus and the app works fine. However, when playing audio from my Bluetooth ear buds, it seems like the app interferes when searching.

5827	fake app plzz removed app	1
5828	I'm all for the COVID Tracker Ireland app and all our family have it up and running. One concern with the included optional phone number input. There is no apparent function to verify the number I input is actually from the phone in use! I could technically add anyone's phone number. This could have a knock on effect as there is a minority out there who like to mess things up for the majority. Just a thought!	0

5835	I've had to take this app off my phone for the 2nd time due to how quickly it runs down the battery. This time my phone was also incredibly hot and I assumed it had just reached the end of its life (it's a Samsung, 3.5 yrs old). Then I came across comments online about this app, battery life and making your phone over heat. I deleted it and my phone is fine again! I'm hopeless with technology but can anyone give some tips on how I can reinstall without the battery and over heating issues?	1
5836	It gives one tension when it says you were in close proximity of infected/high risk person it could also give a warning like a beep or a msg so that one ca be more careful. I have it on 2 devices which always be together with me. Each one of them show different information on contact numbers are quite high like 20 in one 27 in other. Both are always on both has internet on always & blue tooth. They will on me together in one pocket.	0
5837	A great idea, but it keeps interfering with my Bluetooth connection, making it drop out regularly :( This makes playing any music or podcasts using headphones or car VERY annoying due to constant restarts. Please fix ASAP. UPDATE 4 JUNE 2020: Bluetooth issues seem to be fixed. Changed rating from 1 star. UPDATE 12 JUNE 2020: Bluetooth still broken.	0

How many people has been advised to isolate because close contact was detected. Irish Tax money was used for this app. I am disappointed.	1

5869	The apps ask for too much non essential details, which could be stolen when hacked. This had discouraged many people from signing up. 1. Full NRIC is not needed per PDPA, as the last 4 figures would already enable traceability. 2. Date of issue of NRIC is NOT needed. 3. Birthdate is also NOT needed. The above are NOT necessary for the purpose of contact tracing and should be taken out. Good to have, but not needed. Please reconsider the needs to have these data, in future updates.	1

5903	Well designed & intuitive. The additional content is interesting, including the daily statistical updates. So much better than the first app & seems to be much less of a battery suck too.	0
5904	I live in Dover where they had a cluster case but it does not detect anything. I'm not even sure if this app actually detects any unless someone uploads and updates.	1
5905	Constant app icon in notifications bar is not helpful and annoying. Should just pop up if the app stops working. I don't need to constantly know whether the app is running. Since close contact requires more than 30 minutes contact. Scan interval can be reduced to help with battery draw. If it kills my phone while I'm out, it also defeats the purpose of the app	1

5914	Force closed everytime I try to start the application.	1
5915	No way of turning it off when you're not outside. Wastes battery power with persistent notifications. Security issues still haven't been fixed	1
5916	Useful app. EASY to use, now allows group check in.	0
5917	Doesn't install in latest Huawei phones or phones sold in China without Google Play Services.	1
5918	Cant even complete profile, everything except name cannot be validated. Cant register how to use	1

5920	Very good app	0
5921	great app, i recommend this to everyone to use this app	0
5922	Excellent	0
5923	The App would occasionally cause interference to my car entertainment system when listening to music from my phone via Bluetooth. This would happen when my car is next to another. The problem goes away after the App is uninstalled. Would briefing great if Developer could look into this matter.	1

5930	Updated to 1star as the need to reregister after the update is painful. Waiting for next update that has integration. I'm guessing that 99% that would download this has the SingPass app... why not enable some kind of SingleSignOn... click on link and just biometric to authenticate and get identity info? Any idea if this enhancement is in flight?	1

5944	Really good app, great idea and well designed. But what's the point in contact tracing when our own politicians dont take covid and the associated restrictions and lockdowns seriously	0
5945	The app is good but the battery drain especially over the past two days has been ridiculous. Also, my phone was heating up excessively. I was afraid to leave it charging unattended but it was losing battery power so fast that not even using on the charger made a difference. I had to uninstall because I thought my phone was going to go Samsung and burst into flames. Since uninstalling it it's charging faster and my phone has cooled down.	1
5946	Very nice	0
5947	Installed since initial launch, working fine in background untill recent update. Keeps disappearing from background and need to constantly check phone to ensure it is running in background.	1

5966	On Android 10 on 2 different phones, this app causes Bluetooth connection failures for my both my watch and car. Seems to be an issue for Android 10 only, as it caused no problem on my older Android 8 phone.	1
5967	Does this app open ever ?	1
5968	Fully important app	0
5969	I can't open the application itself now I can't go anywhere.. what is the issue in this app	1
5970	For some reason, the battery of my phone is shooting through the roof too. And it happened since sometime last week. It was still tolerable before that although it started to really suck the battery like no tomorrow. And today's the worst. My phone suddenly went flat of battery when I woke up. Usually my phone will still have about 80% battery in the mornings. Last few days it had gone down to below 50% and today is the worst. It went totally flat and I had to wait for the phone to charge from 0	1

5974	Most madarchod app.. worst app of the year, u aren't able to enter mall without this shity app XD	1
5975	It's very good	0
5976	Edit as of 02/07/2020 App seems to be working fine now after some issues with NRIC verification. Impact on battery life etc still to be seen.	1
5977	At last, there's a way to pause. But why restrict to 8 hours only. Why not indefinitely until resumed by user? Using NRIC for SafeEntry defeats the purpose of using random number for exchanges. All places I visit get my NRIC. What's the point of a random number?	1
5978	Absolutely destroyed the battery on my phone. Over heated my phone and is completely useless that you have to have your Bluetooth on. People are lazy, if you design and app that makes people do an action Everytime they use it people will give up fairly quickly	1

5996	I m unable to open this app. I allowed everything than all of a sudden it disappeared from my screan. I installed it several times using WiFi and mobile data but nothing is happening. I complained aswell I have honar 8x, now I m stuck I can not go anywhere. I tired to my old sumsung phone but its showing that your device is not compatible, now please tell me what should I do? I m very disappointed and upset.	1
5997	Invasion of privacy	1
5998	Great app and will hopefully make a difference. However, only 4 stars because the app was very hard to find in the Play Store. I had to go to the existing HSE NI Covid info app, click on the app developer name at the top and see this as the only other app created by the HSE NI. If you just search for 'stopcovid NI' the app does not appear in the search results at all. I am not sure if this is something within the developers control but the more people who can easily find and download the better.	0

6018	Lately I had a problem with the app because the battery in my phone is being drained. I only noticed this problem yesterday.	1
6019	Zain just lost a loyal customer for the last decade. After learning that the company was involved in creating such a horrendous app, I was quite irritated by the fact that I weren't able to rest or take shower mid-day fearing that I'd miss the notification. What frustrated me even more was "bugfixes" update that's total BS. I myself am a developer & wouldn't put such false claims, even if the app was crappy (such as yours). Alas, I'll be disposing my Touch lebanese SIM (part of Zain) as well.	1
6020	It's couldn't open yet a pop up screen come and shows to update latest version then it's stop.	1
6021	Drian battery	1
6022	I was covid positive, I got sms from health department about it hence, my mobile number was listed as covid positive. But the arogyasetu app never changed the green colour. Nor, any of my colleagues, who sit close to me, were notified through the app. What is the exact reason for installing the app?	1

6038	I like the incorporation of barcode with QR scanner, plus allowing to click check out when done.

6059	Idea is great. Ui is well organized. But there is nothing helpful. Everyone have to install this app and submit info. Even lots of people not going tell you they have corona. Because some of them even don't go to hospital. About half of the people don't even have an smartphone and 20 to 50% of smartphone users will never know about this app. So it's not going to help.	0

Not sure who maintains this app and how they mark the +ive status on an specifc mobile number. Looks like there is a complete unorganised structure behind, who is maintaining this app and because of that common people are suffering. For me this app is of no use, but is a annoying thing to have.	1

6132	Very Good initiative. Just a little concern of mine: I don't know how you keep records of Covid19 patient's phone.I could be in touch with a carrier who might be tested positive weeks after. Will i be notified then? Also there should be options for carriers to report for themselves. Without a regular and sophisticated datasets, it won't be that useful regardless of how many are using it.	0

6205	Has been working on Android 6.0.1 until the last few days, when it now requires Battery optimisation to be disabled. I have tried all help instruction and any other possible way to switch off battery optimisation but the COVIDSafe app (v 1.0.48) still will not work. Hope they fix the problem soon.	1
6206	Your Bluetooth function has drain my battery within a day. Very irritating, if it is not instruction by my management, i shall uninstall it.	1
6207	I've had no issues before. After the recent update, however, it now requires me to have location turned on for my phone (previously the app needed permission to access location, but didn't need it turned on). I don't want to turn location on, so I sort of wish I hadn't updated it now, as I'm now reluctant to do everything required to make it work.	1

Not happy hopefully it hasn't killed my phone!	1
6231	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
6232	Why when I checked in at the dormitory. Then the next day at 2AM when I want to go check out for work. The check out button dont have? Please fix this problem ASAP!	1
6233	Reduced battery life for my phone, interrupts music playing from Bluetooth earpiece while this app is running. Have to pause it for music to play continously.	1
6234	Loaded the app, to replace the previous one (stopcovid) and same problem. Keeps stopping. No info why. Only way to get it working is to uninstall and reinstall. No idea why this happens, but looking at comments below it appears I am not only one!	1

6281	Why does the app need to access my camera, files etc? Isn't location and Bluetooth good enough? Seems like you not only want to track our movements but also want to know everything about us. It's an intrusion into our privacy. Whatever spin you are telling us, we just don't buy it. Data security? Well you don't exactly have a good track record on that. Before the election, you said it wasn't mandatory but now that the election is over, you say its mandatory. And you still expect us to believe u	1

6321	I concur with some comments made about the latest update. It seems to use more battery, and there are occasionally issues with Bluetooth functionality. I use a Huawei Y5. My biggest beef is that since adding covidsafe, I have found my Facebook Lite app doesn't work properly. FB can't post or upload photos. Maybe there is a setting on the covidsafe app, which when switched on or off, will fix this annoyance. I wish I knew.	1

6332	Nice simple app, would encourage as many as possible to use. Using phone number is optional. Location is used to gather data to spot clusters. It isn't private data. Only downside is you need a phone that's iPhone 6/android 7, which may inhibit people with older mobile devices.	0
6333	Preferred old version and it had no problem. After updating, cannot proceed. Very disappointed!! Have to uninstall and then reinstall the app to be working again.	1
6334	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0

6359	Breaks my phone. As soon as I install this app my Apps can no longer update from the Play Store, Bluetooth stops functioning (often stops devices connecting via Bluetooth, stuttering and performance issues when they do connect), and tanks my battery. No point in having the app if it makes my phone unusable. Contacted the devs about this, never got a response and app still not fixed. If the Gov expects everyone to be running this they need to fix the issues.	1

Issue doesnt seem be directly attributed to Covid app, but it relies heavily on Play Services which is the culprit (last update). Clearing the Services cache does help at least!	1

Still leaves my phone is a heavily degraded condition.	1
6410	To people feeling "suspicious" or "complaining", that they use public transport and still didn't get the notification - are you *hoping* to get infected? Just a reminder, that to get that notification you need to 1) be less than 1,5 meter away from the infected person 2) the contact must last 15 minutes 3) the person must have the app installed as well. All in all, it's not that likely now, but the app still works and is useful. Let's hope everybody installs it and to never get the notification.	1

6468	Got this app to participate and assist in making Canada safe.  But as is usual with Canadian Federal Government.... they think only one province exists... Ontario.\n\nI have to say, I changed my “Province” to all available and the only province with reporting capability was Ontario. \n\nYou would think that developers of something like this would have at least studied High School geography.

6473	Just on it last night. I am at home all the time yet it shows 700+ exchanges and increasing every little while with trace together users. How is this possible? Bluetooth signal should only be a few meters afaik. So i doubt this app is working as intended. Edit reply: 700+ (and increasing) devices means likely the whole block of flats or maybe even few blocks away. How is this effective? To me it's likely inaccurate if too many people are registered around me of which im not even in contact with	1
6474	The Result is not updated... when i was currently in hospital they done a test to me May 8... Before my discharge (may 11) i received my first negative result, then they discharged me last (may 12) and get a swab before i was discharged. And still isolated for 12 days more. I downloaded the app (may 16) to see my result for May 12. And woop what I see is my May 8 positive result... Even my negative (may 11) result is not posted here.It's more frustrating.. seeing positive, even i have negative.	1

6612	My first impression is very positive. One thing I believe needs amending is where it says 'has a health official asked you to upload your data' the first button should have a 'yes' or 'no' answer. If you press 'yes' then it takes you to next permissions page otherwise a 'no' response will tell you that no further action is required. Update: Told u so! There are now members of the public that think they now have COVID-19 because they pressed the 'upload data' & the consent backed up their fears.	0

6758	Worked fine until this weekend. Suddenly started draining my phone battery. Normally my battery lasts 2 days. It now lasts barely 6 hours. Phone is becoming super hot too. Trouble shooted this by turning on developer options on phone. Wiped cache and also wiped cache on Google play store. Uninstalled and reinstalled apps that were recently updated. Discovered this app is to blame. Once uninstalled phone returned to normal operation and battery life. A fix is urgently needed	1
6759	I uninstalled because it drained battery in 2 hours.	1
6760	Very good app, i love being traced by big government	0

6774	There should be a way to use the app without bluetooth. When I use bluetooth my battery wont last even half a day.... And when I shut it off it lasts for 3 days! So please think of an alternative way (gps or sth) to use the app... At the moment I can not use it because I can not charge my phone in the middle of the day.	1
6775	Only good in giving confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths. Other than that, it still shows my area as a safe zone when there has been already more than 30 cases already.	0

6781	App is simple to use, has clean design and respects privacy. It would be great if we could see a counter on how many codes the app exchanges, currently we don’t have a way to check if it’s working properly. A simple counter that increments when we exchange codes with a new device would be great to see in a future update :) \n\nGood work guys! Canada is much stronger when we all work together ????	0

6787	I'm starting to regret installing this app in the first place; ever since I set up my account, the music I'm listening to via either my Bluetooth earbuds or my BT speaker becomes laggy or gets cut off several times (even if I'm just listening to one song on continuous loop). To top it off, it's literally killing my Samsung Galaxy A8 Star's battery life to the point where I have to recharge it 3 times a day as opposed to only every night previously.	1

6811	Great app but could we also have a smartwatch version? Many smartwatches already have bluetooth enabled by default and it would be a waste to not make use of such technology for those who have smartwatches. Of course those who do not have smartwatches can use the phone version as well or the token.	1

6813	Draining the battery do fast. I'm getting system notifications saying that app has cause several crashes in my phone. App is asking permission for my storage, calls which feels unnecessary. Everytime is broadcasting as a background app \ud83d\udc4e NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL.	1

6848	Surprisingly good! 1) A very good translation in English contrary to what some people say (but my whole OS is in English including Google Play store) 2) And this app uses very little battery on my OnePlus, less than 1% in a background mode (comparing to other apps which uses between 2 and 13%) 3) Functioning and the data usage and privacy are well explained Then, hopefully it'll keep its promise	0

6854	UI is easy and intuitive. What I don't like about this app is that it causes my phone to hang a LOT, drains battery really fast even when I don't turn on scanning mode. Crashes on start-up. I find it hard to believe that there are zero cases in my area or even those with mild symptoms.	0

6865	Extremely battery-draining because this app requires Mobile-Data or Wifi, plus Bluetooth AND GPS location to be switched on simultaneously at all times, plus it MUST run in the background without limiting its usage of background system resources.	1

Ridiculous that such an important app should be having an important impact has caused these issues. I would like to reinstall but will not be taking the risk on my new phone. Very disappointing.	1

6876	1. Since installed cannot see Bluetooth devices near me therefore not able to able to connect. iPhone 5s. Intermittent.  2. Writing very light on white therefore difficult to read when reporting issues. 3. Installed it on wife\u2019s phone and app looks different to my iPhone5s, hers iPhone 8.	1

6883	App developer should overcome IOS constraints and not use this as an excuse for bad UX.  Should add QR code scanner within App and users just need to scan location QR code like what they do in China.  Buses, MRT, other public transport, supermarkets, and all shops can have individual location QR code to enhance tracing efforts.  Now every business have their own scanning and queuing system and it’s so inconvenient for users.  Why can’t SG Govt have a SG-wide integrated system ?	1
6884	It keeps stopping working with the message 'Bluetooth activation failed'. I unistalled, downloaded and reinstalled it several times but without success.	1

6900	Useless . There apparently a cluster 100m from my house. Would have thoight this is the perfect way to keep people informed. Seriously need to be able to opt in for location sharing and no 15min bs. Some people are willing to forego a little privacy to be able to collect the info required to keep this under control	1
6901	Great	0
6902	QUERY! If having to move devices, how are you supposed to transfer the existing exposure checks from the previous 14 days to the new device, in case any of those report a positive case?	1
6903	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

Was in Donegal recently for 3 day break,staying in a busy hotel, it would have been extremely useful to have had this app but as it runs my battery down in 3 hrs not an option.

6936	Twenty five stars	0
6937	Used up the battery from first use. After a week of charging the phone frequently it stopped working. Had no issues until downloading the app. Would not use it. It was not a new phone but worked. Drains battery on older phones.	1
6938	Was working great but in the last day or so it's draining my battery in a pretty major way. I didn't know what it was at first but my phone was heating up and the battery was dropping. Got a notification that it was this app. It's a great app but if it's not updated in going to need to uninstall it.	1
6939	Gives you alerts, alright. The rest of the handling, including who to test, when and for how much is different dependent on who you talk to and where you decide to get tested. Too frustrating, this is uninstalled. Use common sense instead of app.	1
6940	In the latest update, after we update key personal data such as NRIC number and NRIC expiry date etc, our data will be saved. These data can be obtained simply by opening the app. No login is required. Even the Singpass app which is also able to produce our NRIC barcode requires an authentication login to access the data. Please rectify this immediately. I can't even "log out" delete the personal data.	1

6943	1. self diagnosis 2. crashes most often 3. unnecessary features like 3d visualizers 4. bad tech support as it claims to be nation's official app for contact tracing (reviewed comment section) suggestion: 1. create a widget 'one tap scan' - no need for pin to open the whole interface.	1

7001	It keeps closing...not very useful when I get home and realise it hasn't been tracking. I make sure I reopen the app every morning but it closes within a couple hours. I have selected the not allowed option within battery optimisation, so it's not due to that. Update: newer updates have fixed this issue	1
7002	When I update version 1.7.1, 50% of battery charge drained in 6 hours. Not able text any message (Keypad not enabled for few hours, this second time I facing this issue) in any application. Mobile also getting too much heat. Developer's please take action.	1
7003	Ok	0
7004	I downloaded it because i thought it will be easier to check out ... this app makes it even more difficult and confusing (if you are in a mall and then go to a shop you'll be able to check out from shop but checking out from mall is impossible unless you check in again). On the top of that it never detected anything and it's very disorganized. Good looking but very bad UE	1

7013	UPDATE: After a response from the support team they have confirmed that the app is still working in the background, despite the "tracking not active" message. This is a known fault and their team is working to resolve. I have checked my Bluetooth & confirm that the app is accessing my Bluetooth log. ----?- App does not appear to be working. I have the app continually running on my phone in the background however when I click on the app it states that "tracking is not active".	0

7063	There are two mistakes, You have to solve it- 1. Using Bluetooth. (Remove Bluetooth Permission) 2. No update information on the app.When I pick an item It sows to open browser.Even, There is no informative tools in the app.All things depend on website. ( Add update news, without opening browser)	0
7064	Very nice	0
7065	Glad that new update allows to pause the app. Hope it could pause for longer time, since staying at home most of the time, else the battery drains fast.	1
7066	Download at mar\u20182020 but after updated recently come a problem cannot register the details (Fin no...).after uninstall also same situations.	1
7067	This app does not show the true death count from Covid lockdown. It does not count the people who died from suicide or people who did not medical help because Covid fear.	1
7068	For the app to be effective are participants clear that they must sign in everyday.	0
7069	Top class	0
7070	I'd been using this OK for months and (probably after an update) I discovered it was asking for location access and no battery optimisation. Having allowed those, it started draining the battery - 27% one day. I removed it, rebooted the phone and reinstalled the app. So far so good today. About 5th in the list of battery users at 1.8%.	1

7114	The app crashes whenever I try to check in and then later I keep getting calls reminding me to check in. A waste of time at it's current state.	1
7115	When I downlaod the app and wanted to set up the app with my particular, i.e. name, IC no. . . The app will validated and respond that my IC no is wrong despite it is the correct data. I had done loading the app and repeat the set up process at least 4 times and still face the same problem. As for the OTP, it is the same too. Even though I had entered the correct OTP, the app still validated and said that the erong OTP had been entered. It is really fustrating depsite I had tried and tried.	1

7140	I was advised to upgrade the app. I did so. However, the problem still persists. I have sent a few emails already. The scanner would not allow me to scan any Safe Entry at shops or malls. I had to return to using good old Singpass to get Safe Entry...otherwise I wouldn't get in.	1

7143	Location cannot be turned off. Privacy-first? This is tracking garbage at its finest. Simple solution: Uninstall. You need to have location services on at any times using this "anonymous" Tracing App. Meaning you will be tracked by 3rd party anyway. There is no way turning it off which is absolutely critical for a "privacy-by-design" application. Useless ??	1
7144	Tried it I put my number correctly but upon using the OTP sent to my number it keeps on repeating the process can't even register. The develepor should fix this issue.	1
7145	Nice app. Good body guard for us. Now it is very important because of corona	0
7146	Why the Bluetooth need to be switched on which makes my device visible to others, Uninstalling!!	1

7153	Was working perfectly, however in the past 24 hours it is draining my battery very quickly. 100% to 10% in 5 hours. Looking at battery stats it's the Covid app combined with Google Play Services is causing problems. Had to uninstall until fixed so please get it sorted.	1
7154	Good	0
7155	Doesn't tell if it's running or not. The BT batt consumption maybe improved due to change in underlying tech and I assume the changes in the way it works is because of Google requirments. But the app design doesn't show if it's active on background. On android 9 and up there is Google notification when Bluetooth is off. That's how to test if app running. On Android 6,7,8 ..NO such notification. Also NO system log showing any sort of activity as it was in vers1. Chinese phones kill Google Apps.	1
7156	Had to delete the app phone overheating and battery draining.	1
7157	Terrible app	1
7158	Hi. This trace together app can not assessible in Huawei mobile phones. I have bought and then only I have noticed that this application is incompatible to that phone. I have checked with the shopper. But they directed me towards customer service. But still not received any news.. kindly advice me that where can I go and complaint on this issue. Or any other ongoing processes to resolve the issue. Otherwise the government have to cease all the Huawei phones sales which is not assess the GOV.sg application untill resolve this issue.which can help the people those unknowingly purchase these phones	1
7159	Not working, always stop	1
7160	Good initiative for contact tracing. But the app caused music and audio to get "cut off" quite frequently when I'm using my bluetooth ear buds. After seeing numerous comments and feedback regarding this issue, plus the recent update with no changes to it, I've decided to uninstall the app. I really want to help but not with my watch and earbuds disconnecting every few minutes.	0

7173	I can't believe people are whining about the notification being on all the time, the possibility of their battery being drained, about having to turn Bluetooth on and off etc. This app might help to save lives, including your own... that's a pretty fair trade for the minor inconvenience...	1

7188	Pointless. Can only track people when the contamination has been done and does not help to prevent by checking daily the users on potential symptoms to send teams for proper testing. And that if only a person has decided to be checked. The only outcome is to realise that one person has created a cluster. I does not prevent does not help but selfish people will feel free to go out now because there is an app they can blame one. Pathetic gvt	1

7207	No issues installing, also helped my elderly mother install over the phone. Sign up was only hindered by having to scroll to complete some answers and the difficulty mum had with the PIN code. Have had no issues with battery life, minimal impact and haven't noticed any other issues.	0

This used to not happen at all so whatever change was made to cause this issue needs to be fixed. Would happily download it again if the issues is sorted.	1
7212	The app and OTP is not sync. 2 to 3 times the OTP is entered right but it says wrong OTP entered. So i am unable to even start to use this app.	1

7230	Very bad app. Whenever I try registering I get the message error requesting OTP even though the details I entered are correct. Please try and improve these issues . It's also not possible to download on Apple devices with iOS below 13.1.	1

7234	After the app updated this morning and it ask to verify our NRIC number, name and birth date. Only having problem with the NRIC portion. Keep indicating invalid. Could someone look into this problem, please? Thank you	1

7238	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

Defference of opinion between us l feel important to keep Covid tracker as l check in every day and note if Cavan has gone up( 864 less than 2 wks ago and last night 881). Hubby has uninstalled his tracker. Battery drainage and overheating needs to be sorted, quickly otherwise if people keep uninstalling Covid app it will become useless	1

7244	Could be better. Why is it not possible to select text to copy it to, for example, translate the news items in Google Translate? Are only French speakers expected to catch Corona in France? Yes, I can read the French but like to confirm my understanding. And functionally, if I want to disconnect my Bluetooth headset, it is complicated and easier to turn Bluetooth off. But then when I turn it on again, often I have to restart the 'phone to use TousAntiCovid.	1

7256	I used this for a bit less than a month. If you have a new phone with large battery and other apps running Bluetooth frequently, and always have icons in your notification area all the time, this app will just be one more of those, and you probably won't mind it. For me who does not use my phone this way, i found it the number one contributor to battery drain and literally the only notification that literally does not go away, regardless of whether you have the app active (bluetooth on).	1

7274	The idea behind this app is good in order to track down on who's infected and who's not, but this app is an invasion of privacy when it forces to keep Location and Bluetooth ON at all times so they can track your location whereever you are and know when you are moving where and to and how long you have been anywhere, this is the reason why battery drains fast. Totally unacceptable. There is no law in the world that forces anybody to install an app that invades our privacy on our personal phones!	0
7275	There should have explanation in the update of the following: The color of the logo has changed from blue to red. It requires more information such as NRIC. Name, etc. I am not comfortable to provide the additional info without clear reason, which was not required in the first version.	1
7276	Excellent	0
7277	Good to have, but FAR too late. And why is it limited to covid 19? Are there no other infectious diseases?! ;/ Very unclear whether this app works if you come in contact with soneone from outside NI who is running their own local app :( Also, it's just ridiculous that, in this global day and age, each area needs its own app. How much money did developing so many separate apps cost? Let alone for tiny places like NI. Someone should have balked at that, and said, "NO. Let's cooperate."	0
7278	I don't know why your wouldn't install this, let's help the government with contact tracing and accelerate the economic recovery.	1

7296	Got as far as entering my name and postcode, but repeatedly received the error message "invalid phone number" when I tried to enter it. It's definitely my phone number but until the app recognises it I can't begin using it. Unhelpful.	1
7297	Runs my battery flat. Samsung says its the top user. So my phone goes flat while I'm out therefore covid app is not running anyway	1
7298	Good	0
7299	Why is this APP asking for access to the pictures, media and phone calls? Just the location access should be good enough for making the APP functional. Pictures and media are private of each individual and his or her family members and respecting this privacy is very important.	1

7303	1- Very slow to show the result. 2- Doesn't allow users to know who tested positive around them as we axpected it to do so. 3- Doesn't send notifications about the regulation of doing another test after 6 days from entering Abudhabi, which could lead to a fine, although many people are not aware of it, especially ones who chose the PCR and paid more.	0

7314	Quick and easy to navigate the set up. No issues. A great way to notify you of a suspected/confirmed case of the virus in a place where you have been. That way you know to isolate immediately.

7333	Question mark.	1
7334	I give up. Reinstalled 3 times and still does not accept my ic. Phuii First verification code also say I input wrong. Phuiii	1
7335	If the app is telling you your mobile number is invalid when you try to install, disconnect from WiFi internet connection, then type the number in again. Fixes the problem immediately.	1
7336	Terrible battery life since 2 updates ago (s20 ultra), draining 1-2%/h Edit: battery life has been MASSIVELY improved as of last update	1
7337	My number cannot even be verified at all. The OTP does not come in to my phone at all.	1

7360	I have to force stop the app to use Bluetooth devices. I use them as a vision impaired person for navigation. The solution offered by these pelicans was to not use the app. Apparently my tax dollars aren't worth as much as fully sighted people.

7381	Update: App is now working after June 9th update. - 3 stars for being utterly intrusive. __________ Previous review: Bought a new phone (Android 10) just to download this dumb and INTRUSIVE app. Wasted money. Dumb app won't open.	0
7382	What about people who arrived through 'Visa on arrival' and are now stuck in Qatar? the app only allows people with Qatar ID to register so does that make non-Qatar ID holders law breakers? This is important as even the entry to the grocery stores are barred without this app.	1

7425	This really needs to work together with Finnish corona app. Often travelling from one country to another and staying there for weeks, even months. Switching apps might miss potential infection notification because the app stops working when switching to another corona app (confirmed by support. Would be great if the app would still be able to receive infection notification (eg. for 5 days at least) even if another app is chosen for corona app)	1

7459	Radius Alert is not updated with new cases and hence one cannot trust if they are in safe zone or not. I believe Radius Alert is the only reason to keep this app on my phone, otherwise, rest of the info it gives is widely available on the web.	1

7466	3 Jun, it was reported in ST that this app doesn’t work well on iOS and SNDGG doesn’t have any plan to use Apple and Google’s API. I wonder why?\nfurthermore, why NRIC issue date is required!?Too much private info needed for something that don’t work well. How secure is the app and the backend against hacking and data leaks that might happen in the future?	1

7469	Great to see Canada get onboard with an exposure notification app. Especially great to see us adopting the Apple-Google framework.\n\nWhy? It’s anonymous and privacy preserving, runs in the background without draining your battery and has teams all around the world looking at it so will be continually evaluated and improved. \n\nLet’s keep Canada moving forward, together we can defeat COVID-19!

7509	The app is only tracing me at 2AM and 3AM.	1
7510	I already feel safer. Thanks health Canada	0
7511	Both me and several others I know cannot use the app any longer because after a few days of successful use it has started incorrectly reporting the user name and password is wrong. This cannot be fixed by using the “forgot password” functionality, as after resetting it still gives the same error. So basically this issue renders the app unusable and is, I guess, affecting a lot of users.	1
7512	How can you review this when it's only out a week and covid 19 can incubate for 14 days?	1
7513	I've seen people deleting this app because it drains their battery. how selfish!!	1

7517	Bluetooth connectivity keeps dropping to my bt devices.	1
7518	Great innovation to contact tracing. However, from my few days experience, it may affect: 1) Wireless earpiece, connected via bluetooth, to your phone as it may disrupt your music from time to time with 1-2 seconds pause and resume. 2) Battery drainage, usually my phone would last from midnight till the next night but as this app runs in the background it uses up my phone battery and I have to charge it more frequent than I used to.	1

7542	I am unable to fill date of birth box	1
7543	Works fine. Easy install, but an example of what the requested mobile phone number should look like when the +61 prefix is showing would help those who don't know not to include the starting zero of their mobile number. Don't forget to use the friends invite at the end of the install.	0
7544	This app doesn't work for me keeps on telling me to turn on Bluetooth the Bluetooth is on already tried downloading this app a few times now but it just never works	1
7545	Can't even be a participant because I didn't even receive the OTP code. I already triple checked my number as well. And now it blocked me? Well f u too	1
7546	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0

7560	It keeps on showing no internet connection	1
7561	Mostly working from home so I rarely go out and turn off Bluetooth. The app made my phone heat up like crazy and drained the battery very fast. Options to put app on standby should include 3 and 7 days.	1

7571	Totally can't work with my Huawei P30 Pro. can't even download. but I go to playstore, already say that I installed. but I can't even see the apps at all.	1
7572	Edit: Thank you for the feedback. Now it works. Original: Cause 4000, something went wrong http status 901 + a stack trace when you click details, amazing user friendly interface. Thank you very much. Uninstalled.	0

Not a single day I went out and no one came to my home but my setu app showed me that I was in high risk as I am in contact with covid patient and according to my app I am come across to covid patient on daily basis and which between 140-165 minutes. Can't understand how is it possible if I am not going out no one come to my home. HOW?	1
7597	Good	0
7598	I am unable to access as the application will not accept my phone number	1
7599	Seems to work. The notifaction thats always on is annoying. Least I can turn it off on s20. Needs an option to turn that off. Please keep the updates to github. Its good to go through the code to make sure its still above board	1

7612	To get the proper result of this application, everyone must to log in to this app, then only the data will be shared..\nKindly link this app with travel permit site, so that while traveling out People must have to use this app.\n-\nThis should be a compulsory or official move in/out application for UAE	0
7613	Turns inactive on its own all the time No point in having the app if it disactivates itself all the time	1

7620	Once I managed to download it I was very glad to see it doing its job. Iam very pleased with you guys in Government. So glad to live in Australia XX	1
7621	I loaded this app about a month ago. 3 days ago I went into the app and unlike my husband's version I did not have the option to say yes or no to the question had someone from a health dept requested me to upload my details, so a tapped "upload my details" and got the message that I had tested positive for covid ??? I had not been to any medical facility or been tested for Covid ??? So a think there is a glitch somewhere and I have now opted out...	1
7622	Worked perfectly.  Not sure why everyone is having so much trouble verifying number. I had no issue at all	0
7623	Does not work for shopping ctr , ntuc etc....	1

7644	After downloading when I start the app a message pops up "an error has occured please try later or contact customer care".	1
7645	No use for a visit visa holder....	1
7646	Bad. Just another app requiring us to give permissions that are not need in the name of security!	1
7647	Good Apk	0
7648	Keeps switching itself off without my knowledge or input. Something to do with battery optimisation? Problem is, I don't have that option on my phone active, so why does it keep saying the app is not active?	1
7649	The app provides to register only with QID. Can this app be enhanced to capture other identification like Visa ID?How can a person without QID, but with Valid Visa register on this App?	1
7650	Received a positive contact alert but nothing reflecting in app, is this the same phantom messages like the UK had issues with? When is the update to resolve this rolling out?	1

7657	Hi team, from few days of last update number of daily exchange count keeps on increasing even without stepping outside my house. If i open the app, i can see counting in increasing. One day it was showing over 2000 exchange in a day when i was in my house for full day. There is some critical issue with app. I'm using on Samsung Galaxy A70 phone. Please check and resolve soon	1
7658	Good	0
7659	After latest update, the app will close itself with no apparent reason.	1
7660	This app caused my phone to overheat and ruined it - beyond repair. I had to purchase a new phone. Although I know they fixed the issue I will not be downloading again on new phone. I liked this app and checked in everyday.	1
7661	Hardly even notice it.	1
7662	The app keeps stopping and I have to manually reactivate it when I notice it not working, this makes me question its effectiveness to detect properly as advertised	1
7663	Says I have invalid phone number!! My number is not in valid. Tried dropping the '0' but still says invalid. :(	1
7664	Initially in ist week app provides info location wise but after 3 Apr 2020 hiding the information location wise which is not understood. Hiding info from public location wise may lead to the peoples at risk.	1
7665	Good	0
7666	Not able to input my IC Number after Update as the app says my IC is invalid.	1
7667	Dont know how it will actually work, but few first impressions: Setting your phone to constantly use GPS + BT is not good. The battery consumption level is crazy. Language setting: Guys, set your phone language to Swe/Fin in order to control the app language selection. Also: localization to Eng should not be a hard task to do, why wait?	1
7668	Has only found ONE contact I believe. It's rubbish.	1
7669	Do you think hink we could, you know..... Do away with the constant notifications? Otherwise app is fine.	0

7679	In the latest(version 3.0.7) update. Now, it is showing today's (02 August, 2020 | 06:25 PM) actual status.	1
7680	Doesnt support basic functionality of SingPass Track and Trace app such as favourite locations nearby. Bluetooth consumption is far too excessive and prevents this being a realistically useful app. QR scan reading is prone to fail. Full SD card access is an invasion to privacy - it should not have this permission. Sorry but I don't trust this to not be abused.	1

7692	I hope it become helpful to lessen the spread of covid19	0
7693	Easy to use, clear.	1
7694	A handy update will be to show at any given point in time what the current restrictions level for each city is (level 1 to 5), and explain what it means for indoor gatherings, outdoor gatherings, sports...etc.	1

7696	Good	0
7697	What's its use...? Whatever you replied, that point I already got that through Ajay Devgan's Add. But I don't think the tracking is perfect. Also, what about those who don't use Android. Many people who have app don't have location or bluetooth turned on. Also, it will inform us that we were in contact of positive person once it happened. Why government depends on such platform for the tracking which can not be implemented 100%.	1

And fined if they leave quarantine... This app is craptacular... It does not even upload data to a central database to track carriers... It just tells people if they have been near someone who should be in quarentene....	1
7731	Works, easy to install, clearly works in background (has a little symbol at top to show it's working) Read FAQs on website if you have any questions	0
7732	Battery damaged / effected by this app. I uninstalled the app.. BATTERY IS STILL DRAINING. 31/08. Re-downloaded this morning. Battery went from 100% to 75% in 2 hours.	1

7753	I appreciate it.	0
7754	Good	0
7755	This does not work.\n For exemple if I am at a restaurant with plastic windows around me it does not take it in consideration. No app can be 2M precise, and even if you are behind a wall they cannot tell. \nWhich means in a majority of cases.\n This will stress people out more than help people out. \nIt’s a good idea, but we don’t have the required ressources to apply it correctly.	1

7768	Worst ever...battery drain so fast	1
7769	This is completely fraud app. It does not trace at all. All it does is drain battery and shows you are safe. I got infected with COVID. Before that I got near many COVID patients. This app always said that I was safe. Those who created this app should be ashamed of themselves.	0
7770	Excellent application interface. Simple and unintrusive.	0

7782	I appreciate that our safety is being prioritised, however, this app is very, very heavy on the phones. My battery keeps heating up and is loosing power in less that 1 hour. I'm not sure why it requires access to my private media and files but it definitely needs to be altered.	1

7786	Latest update caused huge battery drain - 10% per hour according to battery usage bout l but in the phone settings. Please fix it, previously battery usage was around 5% per day. Currently the app is unusable due to that battery drain.	1

7788	I cannot go to office, supermarket without this. When I tried to get OTP shows error in getting OTP. When it get solved.? I installed ehteraz in my new Nokia mobile. I bought new mobile only to install Ehteraz. Each time I have to buy new mobile to install this software. Please rectify immediately.	1
7789	just a spy tool	1
7790	I downloaded this app as I thought it would be a more convenient way to order repeat prescriptions. However, after providing all my information during the registration process, including my NHS number (twice), entering codes sent to me by email and SMS, submitting four photographs of my driving licence, four photographs of my face, and two videos of my face while reciting numbers, it all appeared to be insufficient to prove my identity! After that debacle the app then froze on me! Unbelievable!	1
7791	Very good	0
7792	Causes other bluetooth device connection to be spotty. Oppo reno2 + sudio tolv bluetooth earphones.	1
7793	Im giving 4 stars because they should also tell how many got recovered	1
7794	Please fix the app. It always failed to log me in to my account. Where in fact i have already have an account. It always says failed to aunthenticate.. when i enter my password which is correct. It fails to log me in. Please.. fix this issue..	1
7795	The app keeps crashing !!! I have been experiencing this problem for more than 30 days. I have been installing every update that comes through but still the app doesn't work.	1
7796	Very good and very useful for us	0
7797	THIS it's the reason our numbers are so low. Want to keep your freedom? Install the app. Nothing to lose. If you're worried about privacy, it records FAR less information from you than Google maps and Facebook	1
7798	Easily done. Protects life	0
7799	It worked! I was exposed in rehearsal, was first notified by a coordinator of possible exposure then the next day I got the notification that I was exposed. The following day I got a call from the government.	0
7800	Just monitoring battery consumption but other than that no issues. Waiting for tin foil hatters to leave a review, frankly, to enjoy some nonsense. Maybe a "i am home" button to avoid battery strain would help?	1
7801	Good application	0
7802	The app is not sending to my UK number!!	1
7803	Haven't used it yet but it's not allowing me to fix or update my flight details and also missing a contact section	1
7804	very helpfull apps	0
7805	Not a word to say, from my personal experience it is not useful, self proclaimed app, waste of time and energy	1
7806	Great app. I have read a few comments from concerned users about needing to have location services enabled on Android. This doesn't mean that the app is using GPS, or tracking your location. It is a limitation of Google Android Software development tools that force the developers to ask for location permission. If you have a look at the code of the app it becomes obvious that GPS is not used. Trust us computer scientists that know what is going on. No degredation in battery performance noticed.	0
7807	And what people do who can't read polish language ???	1
7808	App is stuck on "You Already Answered" error after filling in survey at the time of registration.	1
7809	Deleted due to overheating my phone and causing the battery to drain. Phone still overheating now due to the effect of the app. Will not be redownloading even when bugs are fixed.	1

Initially, it was turned red on the day when I was diagnosed positive and then turned Green when other one for diagnosed positive.	1
7821	Does not help tracing covid. Millions wasted buying this app from a liberal party crony.	1
7822	Good initiative	0
7823	Battery juice quite fast out... If turn off location the battery quite last	1

7826	Good	0
7827	Please allow auto-rotation of screen or scaling of page or fonts. I can't see the full message on my phone. After restarting the application it was fixed. It decided today, after update, that I was somewhere with a Corona patient but I wasn't there at all. My mother got the same notice and she never even left the house. It has to improve. People's life are decided by it.	1

7830	It keeps crashing	1
7831	I can't even register my particulars with the app. It keeps on saying "verification failed; check all fields in red", this is despite me putting in all my details correctly.	1
7832	Simple and straightforward, does what it needs to do, nothing more or less. Multiple independent reports indicate that privacy is adequately protected.	0
7833	Same mobile before its was supporting but now didnt support.pls try to fix it	1
7834	I support this application not because the Government says so, but for the good of the people that I love and for all of us. While I am concerned about how any data will be used by authorities, that concern is of second importance when it comes to survival of us all. Google and all other apps I use, already know too much about me and yet I don't care as I've got nothing to hide. So let's use this app and let's get back to normal life. Both, installation and registration of the COVIDsafe app was easy.	0

Kindly adjust this issue... Your app is not showing a single quarantine center in Rawalpindi.... Why is it so ?	0

7857	Good	0
7858	Quick and easy step through process. No issues on sign up. This week 30/6 I have had issues with the app. Updates are not available. I believe in the purpose of this app but it would not benefit users if noone is getting tested regularily. Its the known cases this app checks!!	1
7859	Keep interfering all my game and my music	1
7860	I've been trying to complete my profile but unable to. It keeps on asking to check in the fields as the validation fails. Reinstalling but still the same result. I will have to uninstall for now as it now useless in my phone storage.	1
7861	There should be means to select the locations similar to singpass as not all would be able to scan the QR code. Case in point, myself with a defective camera in an otherwise perfectly functioning phone.	1
7862	I downloaded the application and registered with my Emirates ID.... And untill now I finish 3 tests and my reports are not shown in application. I reinstalled the application but still its showing error.	1
7863	Useless app. I am a direct contact of a covid positive person and this app didn't bother to inform me anything. Around my area there are so many positive cases, specially in super markets where we regularly go for groceries which I came to know through friends and neighbours. What's the use of this app?	1

7878	Best app	0
7879	Don’t developers realise married couples often share the same email address? This app will only allow one account per email. We often go to visit different places which makes the app useless in those circumstances!!!	1
7880	I have an iPhone 6, it's battery lasts longer to serve the purpose of this app, but this App requires iOS 13.1 and above which looses out to some iPhone users having 6s or previous generation phones. Can this be made compatible for older generation iPhones please?	1
7881	Waste	1
7882	Bluetooth keeps disconnecting with other devices since the app is running in the background all the time. Please fix this.	1

7889	Doesn't work at all. Crappy app. Hire better devs who know what they're doing.	1
7890	Doesn't work without permanently enabling GPS and/or Wi-Fi based location, even though the app doesn't use either. Deal breaker for me as I keep location off for privacy reasons unrelated to this app. Apparently due to bad permission design on Google's side?	1
7891	Very good	0
7892	Very good	0
7893	Keeping the Bluetooth on from morning to evening drastically affected the battery and with every update its unpredictable. I am confident on the privacy of the app what it's been claimed, but the battery drains faster in crowded areas like malls and MRTs. In an emergency if the phone is off due to low battery, who will be accountable?	1

7900	Edit on Fri 11th Sept 2020: Issue seems to be resolved. No battery drain issue since downloaded again last week, thank you HSE and developers. PLEASE tell us when battery drain and phone overheat issue is resolved. Really want this app, but I'm not reinstalling and then waiting to see if it overheats and goes dead. At least give us an update on when likely to be ready again. SOME COMMUNICATION PLEASE ??	0

7918	Simple unobtrusive app. If your in Ireland you should use it. One niggle and that is with the information the app displays regarding covid statistics, in common with major sites it uses 'all time' figures when really what we care about is (say) a rolling 14 day average. Can it be that currently we are running at 31% community based infections ? I really hope not.	0

7922	Bluetooth Range. Class 2 (the most common kind) operate up to 10m (33ft), and class 3 are the least powerful and don't go much beyond 1m (3.3ft). Why not use mobile data to monitor the entire city, country or world?	1

7935	I had this app and it was working for like a few weeks, soon as an update for the app comes out, it doesn’t work. I connect Bluetooth, troubleshoot my phone settings to make sure everything is correct on my end. The app still doesn’t “turn on” as it says on the Home Screen. So yah, I don’t know what to tell ya. I mean getting the app and reporting yourself would be great.. but I’m wondering how many people’s phone is doing the same thing like mine?	1

Two weeks to respond to this problem is failure in my books even though some update seem to fix the issue and I was able to add visits manually within 24hrs if loading it. So mixed feelings on benefits	1
7967	The app keeps asking me to activate but keeps showing an error with Bluetooth, still have the same issue when I delete and reinstall.	1

8012	Seems to be using excessive amount of battery. Update 28/08/20 Since the software fix my phone battery usage has returned to normal.

8025	Because I'd prefer a timely phone call if I've been exposed to Covid-19. And the app doesn't know me, my phone number, or my location. It only has a unique ID that a Health Dept staffer can use to alert me to get tested. A no brainer for everyone to install, so we can get this isolation lifted sooner!	1

8100	Tried to do the right thing, installed and used the app. App unable to function without access to location data. Website says location data is not required. Adding my location data to the already questionable database is a deal breaker.	1
8101	I can't open the app	1
8102	Nice app from government	0

8104	Simple design. Works great. It's reassuring to have that notification constantly on because then I know it's working	0
8105	Excellent App and Initiative by the Government. Regular updates are received. Downtime is minimum.	0
8106	For anyone still receiving an invalid phone number error message, try restarting your phone after downloading the App. This worked for me after a few frustrating minutes of trying to set it up. Don't forget to omit the zero when entering your mobile number.	1
8107	Simple and straightforward, does what it needs to do, nothing more or less. Multiple independent reports indicate that privacy is adequately protected.	0

8113	Since I installed this app, my battery drains in less than 7 hours!	1
8114	I'm repeatedly being told that I'm in the red zone and I should move. My home is in the red zone, what do you expect? And no option to turn off the annoying red zone notification. And also repeated forced close. I understand this app is for contact tracing, but many people don't. Instead of adding more features that will eat more space, why don't make installation of this app obligatory for all citizen?	1

8122	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

8198	I was checking I everyday however my phone has been overheating the last 2 days and having gone through the phone it can be traced back to the app so I've had to delete it. I plugged out my phone and did not use at all for approximately 10 minutes and it drained my battery by more than 10% and overheated again.	1

8201	You're not serious!!! This app is logging out and stops working after couple of days. This has been the case from the beginning. You didn't fix it.	1
8202	To increase trust and adoption this app should be made open source. That way, we all could have a look at the code to see if there's any privacy breach, and could even contribute with an English translation for the app. Plus, Denmark would set the example and other countries would follow. You might think that an open source app is more vuneravle to attacks but this is a very naïve arguments: vulnerabilities are exposed and fixed faster.	1

8207	The only thing i have herd everyone complain about is the constant notification so just do an update and get rid of it. Spoken to heaps of people that deleted it after day because of a notification that doesn't need to be there.	1
8208	The app is very poor, I get error everyday saying you cannot request permission away from your home location even though I request while I am sitting home. Better developers should work on it, I'm unable to go out even to buy groceries	1
8209	Nice	0
8210	Useless!!! Unless the time spent near other users before it logs contact is reduced substantially this app is nothing more than a personal data collector for the government.	1
8211	UPDATE 08/08/20 Had the battery draining issue experienced by others and had to uninstall. I'm using a Samsung A7 on Android 10. I'm not aware of any other apps that updated on my phone that day. Great UI/UX. Easy to get started and navigate. Clear explanation text. Would like to be able to expand Daily confirmed cases graph. Wondering what rounding is used for percentages on Check-ins and how recent spread data is.	1

8216	Well done ScaleFocus!\nThis idea comes in 2007 by the American Doctor Larry Brilliant who suggested to create a website with similar idea of logging symptoms before/during an epidemic in order to isolate the virus spread. I am glad that Bulgarian company recreated this idea in such a short time. Hope they could give the rights to other countries ao they could use it in the prevention of Covid19.\nThe app is simple and easy to navigate. Hope they could add more features soon, as for example the personal statistics tab where you could see the history of logged symptoms. \nKeep up the good work! ??	0
8217	? keeps on appearing even if I already updated my phone's OS version. It is still not responding if I tap the "press to verify". I really don't know what to do. I searched from google and followed every step it says. Going to setting -> apps -> ehteraz -> clear cache and clear data. Then forcing the app to stop and uninstalling and reinstalling it. All steps are of no use. I've been calling 109 many times but always saying their staff will callback after 2hrs. But no call at all. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude2a	1

8234	As the preferred contact tracing app by the government, I would have expected it to be highly functional. Yes, it can manage registrations and has the ability to collect symptoms data. Also, privacy rights are apparently protected when using the app. However, it does not work when scanning QR codes in establishments. I have tried in two separate establishments using the system but in both cases, it failed with an unknown error. I checked and the establishment has apparently registered with the system. I wanted to use in other establishments but only a few companies/government agencies are using it. Additional step-by-step instructions in-app may be required to assist new users.	0

8267	Don't understand why the app requires the Bluetooth to be on to be operational. I was rather expecting it to require the enabling of GPS. Also quite disappointed by the functionality of it. The app should have shown a dynamic graphical representation of all the Covid-19 patients around within a particular range of me. Until this is done I don't see much of an use for this thing.	1

8277	All was going okay till I got into the car and found out that the phone would no longer connect via Bluetooth to the car. It appears that this app takes priority in the Bluetooth selection. The only way to get Bluetooth back for the car was to uninstall this app and restart the phone. I'm using Android 8.1.0	0
8278	Randomly got a warning saying “you may have been exposed in the last 14 days” while I was at home... that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever given how the app was described to work since no one around us has tested positive or reported it in the app.\n\nThis app also needs some serious UI considerations. The language of the exposure warning is vague and not helpful. If I was “exposed” in the last 14 days, does that mean that the exposure happened on the same day and time that the notification came up? Health Canada agents didn’t know when I asked! If it’s waiting multiple days from the actual exposure incident to give you a warning then that’s outright useless because in that window of time you could have been out there already unknowingly exposing others or getting yourself exposed! That kind of defeats the purpose of this tracing app entirely!	1

8369	CURRENT FIGURES, PLEASE!!! We need CURRENT figures of active cases by county and country to give a more accurate visualisation of where we are and how we're doing. County breakdown and nationwide stats display only total cases since March. That number is pretty useless at this stage.	1
8370	Very good app	0
8371	Data needs to be updated. As number of confirmed cases are there in I-10 but app isn't showing any of them City wise data should be added	1

How can we follow the state's orders if the app doesn't even work?!	1

8471	Great idea, would be great if it didn't ruin your phone. It made my phone much slower and made my music cut out constantly when using Bluetooth. It took me a while to figure out what caused it, then as soon as I uninstalled the app the issue was solved.	0

8473	Can't register. The app says connect to internet even internet is connected	1
8474	Would be nice if it had a built-in QR reader so it can provide my encrypted details when checking-in to restaurants, so I don't have to give them my personal details.	1
8475	This app sucks. Just installed it twice when I open its closes just after few seconds.	1
8476	Useless flattering battery	1
8477	Just look at the negative feedback re battery drain, login issues etc. And the government insists that 70% of the population uses this highly flawed app or the equally problematic token before moving on Phase 3. What a joke.	1
8478	In the last few days my battery has been drained by this app . This app is using over 73% of my battery. The phone is over heating as a result.	1

8499	The otp never comes. I have tried several times but still can't use the app.	1
8500	What are batteries? You might think this is rhetorical of sort but it's actually the question u ask when having this app on your phone. Also, it seems that privacy is at an all time low as it asks for every function on your phone. 10/10 would download again if needed.	1
8501	Great protection from Chinese virus stay safe	0
8502	Its a great app, satisfied in this features. I can be no longer think about the virus near our place.	0
8503	I get an error message telling me to tap on a banner at the bottom of the screen to activate the app, then a red message appears saying "Bluetooth advertising failed" (note that my Bluetooth works perfectly with my earpiece) and "reactivate the app/phone, error null [2]" , only God knows what that means.... Of course reactivating doesn't do much good.	1

8530	Great app, every Australian should get it! I'd give 5 stars but for 1 reason. I really don't like the permanent lock screen notification that the app is 'protecting' me. I don't care. I just want it to work quietly in the background and not bother me until it needs to. I'd be quite surprised if any user wants the app to remind them it is there every time they pick up their phone. Please create a setting to turn this off -- then you'll get my 5 stars.	0
8531	Suggestion to use the gps location instead of bluetooth as it drain the battery heavy ly and to keet the blue tooth as a options if you are going to public places	1

8536	Keep say need to sent otp. But otp also never received.	1
8537	My location "Downings' in Donegal is not a location on this app. Downings is a highly populated place at the minute because it is a tourist location. How am I meant to know if someone near me has Covid if my town isn't even on the map? Useless.	1
8538	I have been diagnosed with Covid 19 on 14.11.2020 and its status is showing as You are safe. How come this app is showing wrong status and the purpose for which it was used by the government for contact tracing is nullify as it's status is not at all changing.	0

8548	Easy to setup and a simple design. For everybody worried about the location permission, there is a good FAQ answer where they explain that it is an android system requirement if you want to share data with bluetooth.	0
8549	Absolutely destroyed the battery on my phone. Over heated my phone and is completely useless that you have to have your Bluetooth on. People are lazy, if you design and app that makes people do an action Everytime they use it people will give up fairly quickly	1
8550	Not good for use everyday problem coming not open already updata	1
8551	When i try to install the app Its showing id not valid. I have 3 more months valid id with me.	1
8552	Cannot even go in. Keep on temporary unavaible. Not gonna install ever.	1
8553	This app works but unfortunately it drains the battery. But the worst is not against the people have built it but is more against our politics (Swiss, European, World) which haven’t agreements to exchange anonymous data about peiple might use same kind as f app in other countries. Switzerland is a small, especially if you stay in a border with other coutries France, Italy, Germany, Austria...	1

8555	If its working its 5 stars. But it doesn't seem to keep the tracker on when I leave app. When I open the app I have to enable the tracker (it does auto enable when I open the app, but initially is disabled).

8560	So far so good, the app seems to be working well in the background and notifies me on a weekly basis for the searches it has done. However like other users to search for the app on play store, it will not show up at all. I had to go through the HSE NI site to get link to the app to download it. I hope However that everyone will use this and maybe reduce the R Rate again.	0
8561	TURN OFF WiFi or you will be told your phone no. is invalid and the app wont register. This app would not accept my mobile with or without the leading 0. Tried 4 times and told every time my number is not valid. This was attempted 24 hrs after registrations were enabled. My wife tried same app with same result. Searched WEB to find people saying "Turn OFF WiFi" and it worked. GOVT & THE APP DEVELOPER SHOULD MAKE THIS NO WiFi REQUIREMENT CLEARER. Bad experience likely to affect app uptake	1

I see very less count of interactions or sometimes even 0 whereas it shows a drastic difference with my spouse's Mobile which is Samsung S10. Kindly verify this case with your testing devices. Thanks.	1
8574	The app is burning through my battery power today, I've had to recharge twice - I can normally go 2 days on a single charge. For a public health perspective I don't want to delete but my phone is useless using battery power at this rate......	1
8575	It is working as expected	0
8576	Since it's quite mandatory to use TT app or token to check in for tracking purposes, would appreciate if the TT app Android OS can allow check-in for family members as well, especially children who don't own a mobile device.

8579	Update: After installing the app again on August 11th, it appears to be back working and stable again. Excessive battery drain resolved. Since August 8th this app and Google Play Services are chewing up battery! I'm going to have to uninstall it, I'm losing a percent of battery every 3-4 minutes. The battery usage apps overview shows both this app and Google Play Services (which is tied to the app) as being the biggest battery offenders, using over 45% of the battery in the past 24 hours.	1
8580	Otp not valid	1
8581	No Google cannot use? Seriously? Don't tell me cause of it, you can't sent otp to us. WhatsApp also can be install on hms device and request otp successfully. Please go back to drawing board if you are lazy to develop this app	1

8599	As a developing application, this has started okay. It has provided the ministry with Kerry contact details but it doesn’t give the opportunity to link with your national health if, a further improvement or capability. \n\nIt also needs the ability to manually load in details of where you have been so you don’t need to keep separate diaries or paper records. \n\nI actually found it difficult to find a business in our area using the MOH QR image. Many businesses are using other applications and it has become quite confusing how they all work. For this so to be effective, All businesses need to be encouraged to use the one Covid QR coding system and it should be easy to do that.	0

8614	Very good initiative. But how can we trace a Covid-19 positive person? There is no clear information about how i get alarm when a positive person near me. Why Bluetooth?? I am not sure is the app really work??? Most important is that this app is not found in mobile version play store/IOS.	0
8615	Maybe the app should send a message to the ppl who's phone it's installed on to, and ask them 'how they feel', instead of relying on ppl to go on the app and tell it 'how they feel' I have forgotten to go on it sometimes...	1

8642	Same as below. Battery started draining this weekend. I uninstalled this app and problem solved. Developer needs to find a fix and publicise or the whole purpose of app will be defeated as more people uninstall.	1
8643	This does not work.\n For exemple if I am at a restaurant with plastic windows around me it does not take it in consideration. No app can be 2M precise, and even if you are behind a wall they cannot tell. \nWhich means in a majority of cases.\n This will stress people out more than help people out. \nIt’s a good idea, but we don’t have the required ressources to apply it correctly.	1
8644	\ud83d\ude21The bluetooth keeps disconnecting and connecting when in a crowded area.

8653	Excellent but radius alert is disturbing	1
8654	This app is agein privacy of all human beings and want all your personal info and ask for it thr moment you download rhe app perondaly this just an app to control all of us and take the right of privetcy and freedom and the right to choices you can shove this ugly spy wear yp your own butt	1
8655	Won't accept mobile number.	1
8656	Best app	0
8657	Excellent app for fighting the spread of covid 19. Thank you all for for giving us this tool.	0
8658	Will help us all get back to normal soon if  all Australians download this App without worrying about battery life, privacy issues I found it has very little battery drain and certainly fell safer shopping  DOWNLOAD TODAY	0
8659	Random disruption to my phone's bluetooth transmission to my wireless earbuds and car's audio. My heavy rock bands sound like they drank too much alcohol and are having hiccups while the divas sound like they are intermittently choking on a toad in their throats. Kindly fix the issue.	1
8660	Excellent	0
8661	I never have my Bluetooth turned on all day cause it drains the battery and is a source for intrusive spyware. This app is useless and will not protect you from the virus as has been witnessed in Singapore, but it's an invaluable tool for the police to watch your every move and maybe even fine you if you breach social distancing rules. The age of tyranny and persecution is amongst us thanks to this virus that was created in a lab.	1
8662	it is now requesting location information thid looks like information escalation and given the terrible history of the government with this I am uninstalling	1
8663	Battery is draing too fast and getting heat my phone due to this application so it is really annoying. Please rectify this issue.	1
8664	Was OK. But now it's SMASHING my battery. It's by far the main user of my battery ... delete	1

8669	Was ok until a couple of days ago,now eats up battery over night leaving zero !! Have uninstalled for now Samsung A40	1
8670	Wow this app rocks! Construction industry ask us to all download this app and Covid-19 wuhan almost entered my mouth but this app flew open to block it! This is even better than "only wear mask when unwell" policy! Kudos to the scholar that invented this incredible app. Bluetooth is a new technology that is adopted! Beyond any overseas scholar's thinking, no wonder they are highly paid. Way to go!	0
8671	Is there a how-to somewhere if you want to move the locally accumulated contact data to another phone? I want to use the covid-app on a new phone without loosing the last 14 days of data...	1
8672	Awesome	0

8679	Nice app	0
8680	Great initiative with a well defined goal - keeping us safe. Well done team !! Understand it's not going to have all the bells and whistles on day 1 Hopefully other features get added in the near future I.e more feedback on clusters, testing locations nearby, getting resources (food) if quarantined etc..	0
8681	Burning through battery and phone getting physically hot from it in last 24 hours. Android system reporting the bulk of battery use to be the Covid app	1
8682	Not able to request OTP code for some reason	1

8692	I was in direct contact with someone who tested positive, for multiple hours and in close proximity, and so was another friend of this person. My app stays green and the other person's app turned red. You have work to do.	1
8693	Crash on vivo v7	1
8694	The app is very asthetic! It really doesn't use that much battery and you can disable the permanent notification within Android. I had support for high refresh rate displays which is a nice touch. I'm impressed they made it so quickly. Download this app!\ud83d\udc4d	0

8701	Not good	0
8702	I have a problem. My app crashes frequently	1
8703	The app can't work for me, can only uninstall. My phone will kill it no matter what, even if I ask it not to.	1
8704	Easy to download and will be useful	0
8705	Bogus useless app	1
8706	Bluetooth is always on. My phone is hot \ud83d\udd25	1
8707	It doesn't work.......not interested go to uninstall it so bad	1
8708	The app closes immediately. I tried reinstalling and the result was the same. Unit is Huawei nova 3i. I hope the developer takes note of this.	1
8709	Very bad experience. Who the fool develop this app	1
8710	crashes everytime I open it. have never been able to register	1
8711	Awful. Kept switching itself off and, as far as I'm aware, never helped trace anything. Certainly never saw anything that said it worked. If it gave some public benefit I'd keep it, but I haven't seen any benefit and I'd rather not give governments access to my movements if it doesn't help anyone. Bye	1
8712	Useless app.	1
8713	Great initiative to help arrest Covid-19	0
8714	Not working now	1
8715	Good	0
8716	We done to the team who got this out so quick. People moaning as usual but they have no idea how difficult it is to develop, test and release so quickly. There should be a few beers in the virtual office today.	0
8717	It is very good apps also helpful	0
8718	It can't even be activated as the system refuses to send me an OTP. Even after several tries, no luck.	1
8719	Silly app. Redundant, do not understand why the need to download safe entry as well.	1
8720	Great it	0
8721	I am not able to get into the app \ud83d\ude15.I don't know why. I installed the app and given all the permission but then also I am not able to open the app. Even the start option also not visible.	1
8722	There is a trojan and spyware in the app which was detected by my security software. What about the malware. Should we just blissfully forget about that?	1
8723	It drains out my mobile phone battery faster than usual.	1
8724	good job	0
8725	Good	0
8726	No use of this app.	1
8727	The app has been great, and I'm glad to have it, but since Friday 10th August it has been draining battery life, so I have had to knock the Bluetooth off.	1
8728	I have an issue using this app since almost 2 weeks, it was hang and I restarted my cp since I thought it was just my mobile issue, then I open the app because I need to enter mall for work. I had uninstalled the app and install it once again but the barcode shows question mark (?) I called the agent regarding this issue since almost two weeks and he said that they are working over this matter and he even mention that there are many people facing the same problem. because of this i'm suspended.	1
8729	Trying to register but keeps giving me that sth wrong happened	1
8730	Good thank you	0
8731	Battery drains fast when using this even for short period of time. Prefer singpass over this, more stable platform and loads better and doesn't drain battery too	1
8732	Its more Safety .	0
8733	useful	0
8734	Very easy	0
8735	the power consumption is low, very low. the screen is using most of the available power. I'm running Google location, WLAN and Bluetooth is always on...since years (no power drain). the covid app is running without any complains in the background,??	0
8736	Can’t register. Application failed for my FIN number .	1
8737	This app has never worked correctly on my oppo R17. Current version confirms the app doesn't work even with battery optimisation turned completely off and the app having every permission. Come on you can do better, lives are are at stake.	1
8738	Want phase 3? Better download this app and show to big brother.	1
8739	This apps is very useful ??	0

8750	Works fine for me.	0
8751	The bluetooth interfere with other blue tooth devices, initially thought airpod got problems but i switch another wireless ear piece, still got the same problem. The problem went away when i uninstall thr app. Not to mention this app drains your batt significantly! I am using Samsung Note, airpod pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 while encountering such problems.	1
8752	Ok ðŸ‘Œ	0
8753	Keeps saying user not allowed	1
8754	Not really useful	1
8755	The app stores the encounters on the their servers which is a big NO for me. The data should be stored in encrypted format on mobile itself. Only when a person is found positive, the data, through in-app action, should be uploaded to server. At login, the server can send a 'public-key' which mobile uses to encrypt all data. Mobile itself cannot decrypt this data. In Bluetooth com, the key can be sent to the other mobile, and it can send encrypted info to prevent any unsecure clients.	1
8756	Useful and simple app, everything is displayed clearly and all the needed information can be easily found on the application. I have my phone in English but the app is still displayed in Finnish, this is not a problem for me since I know both languages, but I would imagine that a language selection would be a good addition as one of the steps for setting up the application.	0
8757	Excellent..everybody must download this.. Its alerts about lable of precautions to be taken in any area.. Appreciate the support provided during this Covid times.	0
8758	Goood	0
8759	Bad app not working this app 30 time deleted & 30 downloaded but not working	1

8761	App is great for insight and support but absolutely kills the battery life on my phone	1
8762	Why the OTP didn't sent to my number when i have tried so many times to register?	1
8763	Worst	1
8764	It’s good to let the app track while the app is in the background. It’s very hard to keep the app as a current app in our busy life style.	0
8765	Working fine. An excellent tool to track the contacts of COVID19 positive and will definitely help the healthcare officials fight this virus with help of individuals in society. My concern is that Bluetooth remains permanently ON, user should be able to switch off when he is in home.	0
8766	Helpful app for avoiding places with high potential covid-19 carriers.	0
8767	This is a great idea. To anyone who's paranoid about privacy, you likely give away much more info on a regular basis through games, social media, shopping & other online activity - suck it up, princess. To anyone who's had the "INVALID PHONE NUMBER" error, I did too on day after release, but it seems to be fixed now. Download it, wash your hands, stay home and stay safe \ud83d\ude0a	0
8768	All the informations given / filled up correctly. I was not able to login.	1
8769	Application is not working properly. During last few months I don't have any updates regarding the contracts. Just wasting the battery.	1

8777	Wont activate keeps telling me to restart as soon as possible, tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, tried force stop as well, what's the point in having an app that chooses when IT wants to work.	1
8778	Slow down the phone terribily. Was ranking up in Mobile Legend until I installed this app, lagged and start dropping stars.	1
8779	Will not let me verify my phone number during sign up	1
8780	There is no option for when you go away for a few days and the covid hazards for the area you will be visiting	1

8785	I am deleting. Obviously there is no danger any more if our governments are willing to allow 30,000 to gather for a protest. If anyone contracts the virus because of this, then they should sue the organisers and the government. I know I will. Maybe I'll organise a protest at the MCG next Thursday night, and see how quickly I am fined. Guess what....my life matters too. Dumbarses.	1
8786	Bluetooth is turned on as requested. But there is this permanent notification banner on my home screen and notification dashboard. You don't need to shove your tracetogether notifications down my throat.	1
8787	It gets to track you	1

8789	Very good application	0
8790	Today I can't see my health color only question mark.. I reinstall 4 times, but still the same... any advice please, I already update as well	1
8791	Unable to be installed on my phone. Other than Apple and Google services, can include the app into Huawei Mobile Services too? I have asked several times on this issue already.	1
8792	Very easy and quick to install. For those having trouble with their phone number, you always need to drop the 0 before your mobile number when it follows the country code (+61 for Australia). So nothing wrong with the app!	0
8793	Good app It needs to alert users when entering Covid hot zones so we can up our precautions.	0
8794	The app is so slow. It needs a lot of improvement. I also tried creating an account using the app but it keeps on saying na there is a problem with my connection. Ph ano na?	1
8795	Absolutely destroys your battery	1
8796	Very good	0
8797	Lousy app, always hang, drain battery. If this gov wants to force the people to use it, improve on it before you impose on the people.	1
8798	The app was working fine untill it asked for update this morning then it started giving errors and would not open. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still gives error. Then i opened the App info and the only way to make it open was to give permission for the App to Install unknown apps. After than when it opened i cannot login with my old registration and i cannot re-regiater because i get error sending OTP. I was unable to go to work today as i need the app to enter.	1
8799	Works and just runs. No issues with so far.\ud83d\udc4d	0

8805	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0

8871	Worst maintanance, No record is maintained if one tested and confirmed as covid positive with using same mobile in both for testing and login with same mobile number. It would be useful if it is integrated with covid testing data.	1

8902	The app is very user friendly and simple. Its really easy to use although, the only complaint I have is that everytime I go out I have to manually put contact tracing on. Other than that the all does exactly what it says on the tin ??	0
8903	Not able to register. Always saying error getting OTP try again. I am not in qatar right not. Is it due to that? Do I need to register even if not in qatar?	1
8904	I use the app and check in daily. An improvement might be that if a user gets a positive test result they should be able to enter a code immediately as waiting for contact tracing call doesn't happen for a few days after so app is only notifying contacts of previous 10-11 days no 14	0

8919	Ever since I installed this app, I've been having many issues with my phone. The battery drains so quickly and the system lags all the time. I prefer using the SingPass app. Can't this app be removed altogether? It makes no sense to download another app when there is an existing app that works perfectly fine. Kindly look into this so that we can have less issues while dealing with this pandemic. Thanks.	1

8963	Good app to start with!\n\nHowever, suggest to use GPS from the service provider, instead of opening the app and running it in the background — May want to refer to Pokémon go (adventure tracing) where it can tracks location and distance whole the app is closed.\n\nWaste of battery and heats up the phone.\n\nThe application runs too slowly or crashes on older iPhone models.\n\nAnother suggestion is to only turn on the app when the user is in a crowded place, meeting, dining, where one lingers more than 30min.	0

8967	I was installing the app while shopping and have difficulty in login process.But when i got back home and download and install and very easily done .	1
8968	Whenever it asks for permission to access my data, and I deny, it crashes, making the app ineffective and useless. It only works if I grant permission, and the permission includes: 1) Access to all pictures, media and files 2) The ability to make and manage phone calls 3) Your location at all times I will not give the app these permissions without any justification. Please amend this issue. Do not download unknowingly, email the Ministry of Interior for guidance and clarification.	1

8976	Pointless waste of time installing - it won't let me register to use it as it keeps telling me my (perfectly as valid) phone number is invalid. And yes, I tried multiple times (and my partner had exactly the same problem on his iPhone).	1

9038	Battery usage has gone crazy over the past day or so. My phone has started flagging constantly about abnormal battery usage attributed to this app, and that I should disable background use. I figure that would defeat the purpose, so my only option will be to uninstall if it keeps up. Help please!	1
9039	In theory: great idea In practice: horrendous. Privacy invasive, breaks bluetooth, crashes constantly, doesn't automatically start at boot most of the time, drains battery life at places like a school, does in app updates which breaks itself. I get you need to have an app like this but Google and apple has added contact tracing into their os, and from what has been said it works better.	0

9094	Many people don't understand their security settings. Location includes capability to use bluetooth (seeing surround bluetooth devices can be used to determine your location).

9110	Battery drain rate is significantly increased. (My phone can usually last 1 day with no problem) Some bluetooth function lost/ cutoff with BT headphone.	1

9116	A great app! Well built and completely anonymous. I hope enough people will install it. Kudos to Belgium for this!	0
9117	After new update, appear popup "the app keep stopping" if we try to get in. Solved! You must give full permission for your bluetooth, not only when we use the app	1
9118	Very clear interface and well designed! Deducting one star because there's no option to set a daily pop up which would be very helpful. Otherwise, a great app!	0

9122	Actually i cant use this app because i already download it but it kept crashing and didnt want to open and said thad the app keep stoping and i need to close it, so i decide to uninstall it and install it back. But it do the same it keeps stopping.	1
9123	I tried installing it several times thinking that they were unsuccessful, until I finally gave up. On the last install, thinking it was still unsuccessful, I left it on the phone and went to sleep... suddenly the next morning, I found that it was successfully installed. Perhaps something could be done about the problem, so that more people would install this Apps on their phone.	1
9124	Since latest update, CONSTANT crashing and battery draining, not to mention interference with bluetooth devices.	1
9125	Minor bug If your not on the standard route it is always showing ???? "Location Service activated" on the Android notification bar and cannot be removed, only after restarting the phone/app Using Pixel 3 xl.	1
9126	Disrupt my other bluetooth devices and disable them	1

9146	Such a pathetic app!!!\nNo information on proximity with contagious person. It gives you only stats. Such a waste of time and money (I suppose). The Council of Ministers should be more careful before relying on such misleading apps. Unless the main purpose is to collect personal data, is it so???!!!	1
9147	Today I complain about this Apps, the CS asked me to unisntalled the apps, update the mobile software, restarted my mobile and re-install the apps. But the ehteraz cannot open, even all permissions I put "ALLOW". Now I am stuck at office, cannot back home without activate my ehteraz apps, the security are not allow me to pass the gate. Several calls to CS (109) but there are no one give solution.	1

9162	Most stupid application. Why can it use GPS/Mobile cells/Public WiFi access point to access user location but only Bluetooth, which is only at a short distance. And only works if another party also has Bluetooth turn on? Please learn how Korea do it! PS, don't use private information as a excuse. Telco has these information all along. Work with Telco etc to get these info. No one is asking you to release these info to public. But is a important tracking information if one get Covid-19.	1
9163	useless app	1
9164	Very good Very useful	0
9165	Why do we need to switch on Bluetooth?	1
9166	1/8 Latest update cleared lock screen issue but after the the third reboot today to clear crashed and hung Bluetooth I am still far from impressed. Seems to fail when passing other covid app equipped phone but not long enough to connect. 2/8 today two reboots required at shopping centre. No other Bluetooth apps running.	1
9167	The key to pubs, clubs and community hubs! Forget the hype and just download the app so we can all move on!	1
9168	It was not working before on my mobile but now i updated it and it seems to work. I think it is smt.useful. Merci beaucoup.	0
9169	Good	0
9170	After your recent version update Bluetooth keeps disconnecting with stupid message like did u accidentally disconnect Bluetooth. Listening to Spotify using Bluetooth is an issue now as Bluetooth keeps disconnecting and reconnect, likewise for Apple Watch.  Uninstall the apps solve the issue. If u guys want to hit certain % of usage, solve your Bluetooth issue. Device used is iPhone with iOS 14.2	1
9171	18 Sept: the app start to prompt the safe entry QR code is unavailable. please assist to check and advise. thank you.	1
9172	Useless	1
9173	Good	0
9174	Battery saps very fast because Bluetooth have to be on all the time for the app to work. Why not use GPS signal instead? Or Wifi.	1
9175	Such a noble initiative in this moment of severe crisis.i don't actually know its outcome yet but if it works,then it would be kind of a blessing to keep anyone distant from a covid patient and tracing an one as well!But before that you need to reach this info with wide no. Of people and make ensure of its using.	0

9203	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0

9207	Same as all the other recent reviews - since the most recent update it's been draining the battery so badly. Phone cant last a few hours of non-use without needing a charge. Samsung S8	1
9208	EDITED After downloading this app I could no longer access a number of other apps, including for banking and papers. Had to uninstall. Happy to reinstall if this is fixed. Gave 3 stars as I think this is a good initiative but I can't have it installed due to these other issues. Suspect the issues are due to a work required app which I'm aware affects some other settings etc.	1
9209	It is very convenient to use	0
9210	The application is crashing now and then, beeds prior advancement please see	1
9211	The OTP came in more than 1 minute. Before I could type in the OTP, the verification page went off. After re-installation of the app, seems that I am registered, despite no OTP was entered.	1

9217	After installing my battery life had gone bad overnight idle at home easily 35% gone the following day. When outside just merely 4 hrs not even using the phone much drain from 100% down to 60%. I am using Galaxy Note 10 with OneUI 2.5 and Android 10. I temporarily remove the app to check if the battery massive drain stops. I also have a friend using Samsung Note 9 and have the same issue one tome complain about phone getting hot even not using same as I experince I have also.	1
9218	Nice	0
9219	Installation was simple enough and it didn't seem to interfere with notifications or the battery life, but if I get a phone call while my phone is locked then I can't answer it unless I've got my Bluetooth handsfree connected. Unfortunately had to uninstall. Works seamlessly on my wifes phone though.	1

9232	My 3rd time having to uninstall and reinstall. Trying to do my best and help towards Covid fight. App has great potential but it fails too often. Tells me tracking is off etc and it's due to its own "update"	1
9233	Why does the app needs access to photos and media files ? I understand that they need my location but why do they need my photos ?!	1
9234	V good apps	0
9235	Great idea, but it is completely draining my battery. Hardly managed to get past lunchtime when I have to charge phone up again, and this might not always be possible. Not much use if I my phone is dead and I come into contact with someone that may have covid19 ?? Unfortunately I had to uninstall the app ??	1

9261	I know it is 1st version so some stuff might not work properly but the draining of the phone battery that's an issue need to be well considred else ppl will remove the app to keep her phone working longer	1
9262	Useless. I downloaded this app from the time they adviced to download this. I live in Melbourne and working in a covid ward in a public hospital but this app never notify me if I am closeby to any covid positive cases. Well I am definitely like less than 1m with covid positive patients many times. It means this app is not working at all.	1
9263	App started rapidly draining battery in a matter of hours since 8 Aug. The only way to stop it was to uninstall Google play services updates and re install them when prompted by the Covid tracker app. Seems to have done the trick.	1

9282	Takes a very long time to download and set up. Spent two days downloading the app and two more days trying to set up the app to no avail. I can't even get past the otp verification because of how long the app takes to load and this leads to me having to retype my phone number numerous times and the app sending multiple otps to my sms.	1

9349	Good app	0
9350	Nice idea but uninstalled as it causes connectivity issues with other devices, most importantly hands free in the car. Also causes much higher battery drain.	0
9351	Why make this app when u18s cant use it. There has been multiple spikes of people from as young as 15 yet they wont be able to register	1
9352	Kills my phone's battery. Uninstalled.	1
9353	Great app. Easy to set up. If you're worried about privacy, you already have Google and Apple apps that violate it. No point using privacy as an excuse for not getting this app.	0
9354	Consumes too much battery life. Must improve!!	1
9355	App reports green and working in status bar, but when I tap on the app status, it opens showing it's not working because either GPS or Bluetooth is turned off, and I did not turn either of these off. Confusing. Concerning more so because I discover this halfway through or after a day out!! If mine doesn't work reliably, does anyone else's? If it's not working reliably for everyone what's the protection level? I supported and pushed the concept of this app and still do. Get your act together!	1

9357	Drains battery shortening battery life.	1
9358	Random disruption to my phone's bluetooth transmission to my wireless earbuds and car's audio. My heavy rock bands sound like they drank too much alcohol and are having hiccups while the divas sound like they are intermittently choking on a toad in their throats. Kindly fix the issue.	1
9359	Great app doing great work, need to be able to edit Diary Entries, accidentally put in the wrong date and now it’s locked.	0
9360	Doesn't work without permanently enabling GPS and/or Wi-Fi based location, even though the app doesn't use either. Deal breaker for me as I keep location off for privacy reasons unrelated to this app. Apparently due to bad permission design on Google's side?	1

You already have activation code via SMS, and already asked for full name and identification number, the other 2 pieces of information is unnecessary (something a bank might ask). It's an open invitation to be hacked ...	1

9400	Was a good app, but battery drain issue means I had to uninstall it. Please fix it so I can use this app again.	1
9401	The app is a battery drainer, there's no two ways about it. I use an automation app to disable bluetooth when I'm at home and re-enable when I leave home. That's made a world of difference to my battery life.	1
9402	Keeps stopping installation when it gets to PROCEED	1
9403	Some scanner at malls not able to scan the barcode generated by this app. Pls look into it.	1
9404	This CovidSafe tokenisation should be integrated with businesses that need to keep customers information , a quick QR scan and verification message/ sound that the location /business is recorded. Instead of having to (mis)enter your details each time manually/handwritten or mistakenly deliberately because people don't want to leave their details everywhere	1
9405	Very bad	1

Please fix the apps, and please don't recommend people to use it when this apps isn't working. It's added unneeded stress	1

9431	This app in principle is a brilliant idea. I've had it for nearly a month no issues. In the last week the charge can't fall out of my battery fast enough and its causing my phone to restart a lot. I think other apps are crashing now too. I've had to uninstall it. Please fix and I will try again.	1
9432	Review delete karta hai maaaadarjaaaaat	1
9433	The app used to be useful and working fine, but since it asked me to update yesterday, it has been crashing every time I try to open the app.	1

9440	After updating it is not working even not opening.please fix it accordingly.	1
9441	Enabling bluetooth and running in the background at all times is not only detrimental to the battery life of the device, but also opens up a hole in the device's security. I knew I was taking a gamble by downloading this app, taking in account the experiences I have had with other government applications, but now I am sure that I shan't ever download one of these things again. It's simply appalling.	1
9442	Interface should be improved.I hope new features will be added soon	1
9443	Great	0
9444	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
9445	Good	0
9446	I salute the technological prowess of the Israelis. But quite disappointing that the App was perhaps intentionally designed to serve just the Jewish speaking people alone as only the Hebrew language is used as medium of instruction on the platform. I had to uninstall it as I couldn't understand how to navigate on it. Please do well to make it multilingual. Thanks	1
9447	Unable to proceed with My NRIC . I try a few times, still at register page .	1
9448	After reinstallation the app did more than just the splash screen.	1

9450	After last update the App refuses to start with the message: Sorry, you cannot use the application because the device has been rooted. But my device is not rooted. It is Huawei Mate 20 light, model SNE-LX1, EMUI 10 with latest security updates. Probably your application detects that I have Root Explorer installed. Please fix this Bug.	1

A man behind him coughed on him! later that same guy said he had covid and was registered with this app but thought he was fine to go shopping! At Woolworths Gosford Imperial Centre Gosford NSW Australia 2250 Friday 11th September between 9am and 10am	1

9457	Unfortunately i have been disconnected with this EHTERAZ app last night on 2020/9/17 i have tried to register again but it denay by msg of (excced use of this number)so i want to register once because it its needed in every work place mall etc i need to show to it to perform my daily work so I urge u to geant me to register this app and i request to keep me in with my own number	1
9458	Seems pointless to have to manually input your test results. I know a couple of people who have had it and they did not add their result, rendering it ineffective	1

9461	There is a common complaint that users with BT earphones are facing audio stutters with TT app. I faced such issues with my Samsung Note20 Ultra and earphones like Sony WF1000m3, Jabra 65t, and Jabra 75t. Pausing the TT app resolves the issue straight away. (Undeniable proof TT app is interfering with BT audio) I hope you can fixed this common problem. And please don't asked me for info like firmware, software versions etc or give template reply. Please work to resolve the common problem.	1

9483	I cant seem to use the app.Despite having a good connection,the app keeps telling me that there is a network issue.Please fix this.	1
9484	Ever since the last update, I find that the app drains my battery faster.  If an app murders phone battery, and I’ve a dead phone before 3:30 pm, it’s gone.  After uninstalling, even after moderate use throughout the day I’m still sitting at 53% after 5 pm.	1

9502	Works great, but you should really add language selection. Not everyone wants to use the language their phone is set to. Also, my friend who lives in Helsinki cannot download the app because he has a Canadian Google Play account. Maybe make the app available to everyone? There are a number of foreign people living in Finland who can't or don't want to use the Finnish Google Play.	0

9522	I have had the app since inception but the latest version/update requires location services turned on in addition to bluetooth. I do not have location services activated as it drains the battery, encourages unsolicited notifications & advertising, and search engines make incorrect assumptions on the information I am searching for. Why the need to know my location?	1
9523	Hello there! I cannot register when I enter my mobile number, It says please enter a valid a Singapore number. I use the same number to call and for bank updates. I dont know what is the issue with the service. Mobile network is TPG	1

I still get the same error and I'm unable to register. You need to explain the errors better instead of wasting our time; "not enough numbers", "include leading zero", "unable to send pin because of network congestion, try again in a few hours", "phone or OS incompatible", "incompatible with phone service provider"	1

9577	Was working great but in the last day or so it's draining my battery in a pretty major way. I didn't know what it was at first but my phone was heating up and the battery was dropping. Got a notification that it was this app. It's a great app but if it's not updated in going to need to uninstall it.	1
9578	Is there a work around solution for Huawei phone user?	1
9579	Definitely should be downloaded. It is missing a few key elements one of which is the inability to dive down further into each county where potential hotspots might be. This information should be included in the app (considering we are being asked to volunteer this information anyway rather than lumped into a particular county. The app doesn't function properly without location services turned on anyway) Right now it's only half as effective as it could be.	0
9580	Probably an edge case, but I use 2 separate accounts on my phone to keep work/private separate. It works fine for the admin account, but the second user account gets errors and won't allow for scanning. It's annoying because I want to use this, but I can't.	1

9636	Why does this app need access to personal data e.g photos, calls, messages etc? And why does it matter that device is rooted or jailbroken?	1
9637	Had no troubles, works ok from day1 of release. Now i find out the phone app had battery optimization enabled which prevents app from running correctly. Uninstalled + reloaded as i thought app was the issue. Then used PC and Google to locate how to ensure no optimization on the app. I only turn bluetooth on when i leave home. So no battery issues.	1

9646	Great initiative by the SG Government!	0
9647	Good	0
9648	Won't accept mobile number	1
9649	Broke Bluetooth connectivity on my phone and drains battery life, have uninstalled.	1
9650	My friends are positive. My report still not get...	1
9651	Doesn’t work with ios pre 13.5!!!	1
9652	Yyyy so slow	1
9653	I see one exposure, but still low risk, without knowing the time it happens, so it's a bit useless to know that. If you cannot provide at least a date & time for the contact, I don't see interest in this app.	1
9654	Its not sending verfication code	1
9655	After installing is completed, can't proceed to verify mobile no. No OTP received at all no matter how many times I clicked on "resend".	1
9656	Pros : 1. One stop management without having to move between apps like camera and Google chrome to check in/out Cons : 1. Drains battery of mobile phone alot faster before installation. 2. Affects stability of bluetooth connections between mobile phone and other devices such as wireless earphones. Connections either hanged or dropped intermittently	1
9657	Good.	0
9658	It would be nice to have an auto update. I just manually updated from 1.0.11 to 1.0.16. I have no security issues as Siri and Alexa have more information	0
9659	Awesome!	0
9660	This app really drains the battery.... electricity does not come free. It comes from both nature and hardwork . Sad very sad...	1
9661	Using 29.7% of my battery charge	1
9662	No good	1
9663	I've received the 6 digit number but it keeps on saying WRONG OTP ENTERED 	1
9664	Great app. Helps keep the Rona away!	0
9665	As soon as I installed it my Bluetooth crapped out, so my calls brake up and it sounds like I am talking under water when I am connected to my car. I spend most my day on the road. Uninstalled it and everything was back to normal.	1
9666	I dont know what you have done with the latest update, but it has destroyed my battery power. I left the house for 3 hours for study and my phone died before returning home. Charged my phone to the same level when I got home with the app off and I only lost 2% battery power in the same amount of time. Useless if your phone dies while you're still out :/	1
9667	The app is stupid as frick! First of all one shouldn't be allowed to input a false name you idiots. Secondly it is telling me "an invalid phonenumber". Do you know my number? No you don't. I know it. It is valid believe you me! Twice it happens out of 2 tries. Pretty bad!	1
9668	The frequency of interruptions whilst listening to music over Bluetooth is getting ridiculous	1
9669	There are huge privacy and safety concerns because app pretends to be open source and in reality is just a PWA downloaded from government's servers. Event if we compile it from source, there is no way to verify if huge part downloaded from those servers AT RUNTIME is the same as in the github repository or maliciously modified by authoritarian government.	1
9670	Incomplete is information	1
9671	way not working	1
9672	Easy to install and set up, no problems. This app will help get us back to a semi normal life.	0
9673	Excellent app. 5*****Mine is working from the 1st shot. Very easy to use. I dont know why for others its difficult.	0
9674	Amazing	0
9675	Tells me my functioning mobile phone number is invalid, so can't use it so far. Will update rating if this gets fixed	1
9676	Crashing in note 10 samsung android 10	1
9677	It drained my battery overnight from 100% and it also overheated the phone! What's going on?	1
9678	Great idea. But after running it for a few hours, it serverely slowed down the performance of my phone while also draining the battery. I uninstalled it and everything was back to normal.	0
9679	Helpful	0
9680	What a waste of space. Theres no heatmap of Covid locations (im right in the middle of a hotspot) theres no notification saying ive been in contact with anyone who has tested positive (since found out ive been in contact with 3 people told to isolate) and theres no information other that state by state numbers which are not even accurate. App uninstalled and residue file system files deleted.	1
9681	My Samsung android hp cannot complete full installation, will hang at 98%. Kindly rectify this problem. Thanks.	1
9682	Good app	0
9683	Why this app don,t work some people mobile phone. it's can,t be installed.pls tell me what can I do. And someone give this app in my Mobile. But the app can,t be installed and in the corner have option run.	1
9684	Shlonik keeps stopping The App is not working.	1
9685	I have many Bluetooth/ traced contracts even I stay at home with my wife. It reached sometimes 90+ per hour. I removed the app and reinstalled but it seems normal. Is that an expected behaviour or can I just ignore that? It seems odd since there is nobody around me most of the time.	1
9686	Eventually OTP sent and I was able to register/start the app. Thanks for helping to keep us safe!	1
9687	I have tried atleast 10 times with gaps in between and it keeps telling me my ph. No. Is invalid!!!!that is BS. As ive had the same one for 27 yrs.Not impressed!!!	1
9688	I can't open the app after installation. Shows" Ehteraz keep Stopping". What I do?	1
9689	The app doesn't have any English language option. What even is this app?	1
9690	The apps keeps stopping and I can't even open it.	1
9691	The app is always "temporarily unavailable".	1
9692	Widget for Android?	1
9693	Thanks, you have solved my problem and now it is working on my note 8. I give 5 stars for your timely interference	0
9694	Server not responding. Couldn't load. Bug in app. Don't install. If you have installed don't update. Update messed everything.	1
9695	Nice	0
9696	This app has an inherent flaw - it only alerts you if you have been in contact with someone once they report it in the app, which could be days later after you were in contact with them. \n\nSo if someone was infected and didn’t know for a week, and you were in contact with them during that time, you could have been possibly infected too, and you only learn it once the person who infected you tests positive and reports it, sometimes 10 days after you were in contact with them, when they could have been infectious.  During that time you could have infected more people yourself.\n\nThe app is not foolproof and is dependent on people getting tested and reporting a positive case as soon as they develop symptoms or suspect they could be carrying the virus.	1
9697	its hard to get the permit \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d	1

9700	I thank my beautiful Country for such precautions that would eventually save the lives of thousands of people. Stay strong and stay safe, love you all.	0
9701	Just a Tip on saving battery life , pls ON ur Bluetooth only when ur outside/ commuting . U don't need this app to be working when ur home.	1
9702	Great app but draining battery	1
9703	I believe that in this app should be included actual governmental restrictions and requirements.	1
9704	After installing app battery drains super fast. It also caused my samsung smart watch to frequently disconnect from my phone, which causes alot of inconvenience. App should be optimised so that these two things does not happen.	1
9705	Good	0
9706	Can't get the OTP number. Is that Huawei phone problem?	1
9707	Good	0
9708	It is good app. However, I recommend you to give district wise details also.	0
9709	The app is a positive contribution to the fight against CV, but there really needs to be an audible notification for the photo requests. Without one, users are likely to miss the requests unless they are prepared to stare at their phones all day.	1
9710	Great initiative! But battery drainage is quite significant on my device. Deleting while I'm at home, will re-install once I need to get out of the house for work again.	0
9711	not working with my information	1
9712	We just have 5 days to use it and it have a date issue. Please fix it asap	1
9713	Finally is work, great job....	0
9714	Bluetooth connectivity interruptions make this so very annoying especially when in close contact to others. Please make work without needing to mess up Bluetooth.	1
9715	Can't get past phone number entry. Stuck on another county. Same result for all my family too	1
9716	This needs sorting I can't change my country code from Singapore to uk	1
9717	Had the app for couple of weeks, it runs down my battery quick, I will not re-install it until this is fixed	1
9718	The app has good purpose and it gets it's job done very well, but why does it ask for a storage access?	0
9719	Rubbish apps I can't go to duty now this apps making problem in my phone	1
9720	Easy to install and set up. Let's hope it helps to get our country back to near normality again :-)	0

9763	The app is good,but i think you can make it more realistic and accurate by adding photo of the person.Because by name the police or any other authority won't be able to identify where the name and the person holding the app is the same. I have one doubt , whether this app can be opened in more than one phone with same QID.?	0
9764	Won't download. Wasting my time and data.	1
9765	Good	0
9766	I downloaded this app few times but unable to use. NAME & NRIC not recognised.. Have to delete it again in frustration.	1
9767	There is only check in option and no check out option. For MRT will be confusing of when to check out on our first location. And when we reach our destination, no check out option. So we have to check out on our first location and do a check in on our final location and immediately check out on our final location. Not user friendly.	1

9802	The application drains the battery very fast, 11% in few hours. This needs to be fixed ASAP since we can't really use it outside without a charger. Except this, the idea is really excellent.	1
9803	I tried many times to install always give me ? I call tech support they recomanded uninstall & install, after several tries it okay.an update came, then same head ache. Beside this app is consuming mobile battery very fast (I used to recharge each 36 hrs now almost 7 Hrs) When this app force to use mobile data when no WIFI coverage always its costly and made always sound peep till you open the data. After installation green code appear which is nice but not necessary true as no medica test taken	1

9819	I changed to a new phone. I installed the app on my phone and want to re_register tracetogether onto it. However, i am unable to register my NRIC. Do advise.	1
9820	Why the French are deleting contact-tracing app? Nearly half a million French people uninstalled StopCovid contact-tracing app soon after downloading it. This app has alerted just 14 users about their potential exposure over the course of the last three weeks. That's despite France recording many new cases of the virus every day.	1
9821	Use Google's COVID-19 API boss, your tracing is suck!	1
9822	Apparently my phone number is invalid and I did drop the zero then I tried with the zero and tried both ways multiply times. As other reviews have stated if your number is invalid wait a couple of hours then try again and it will work.	1

9833	Great initiative! Really important. Very straightforward and easy to use.	0
9834	Grand, i mean i see no benefit to it really, if i could make a suggestion. The covid restrictions change often. Could you have a simple, quick to access, list of current restrictions for my current location (i.e. county)	1

9836	Had to uninstall. The application enormously consume battery and overheating device.	1
9837	Only just downloaded as I was hoping to get an idea of ACTIVE cases near me. Nope. Just the total cases by county since the beginning. Absolutely no good to me. Could we get a look at active cases by county please? In other words cases younger than 21 days. As for battery use time will tell.	1

9918	Sucks all battery power and storage on my phone, had to uninstall	1
9919	When I woke up and pick up my phone from charging station early in the morning, this app already clocked in more than 25 exchanges. Looks like such a dumb app that records every single exchanges, not only wasting phone resources, but potentially collecting unnecessary data. Extrapolating such massive data can indirectly reveal much more information than the necessary relevant contact tracing info. The safeentry module is redundant when token is introduced at each shops.	1
9920	Useless app and wastage of taxpayers money.	1
9921	Excellent app	0
9922	No battery drain on android. Easy to use. Hopefully it does what it says on the tin.	1
9923	The idea behind the app js awesome, but the implementation is awful, currently its the only app that drains 25% of my battery, while I need to use my phone for work, I cannot leave such app tp run, so I had to enable battery optimization back, and disable the Bluetooth tracking. If this issue is fixed in the future might consider in enabling it again. Or might remove the app due to irrelevance, had a contact with a COVID carrier, app didn't notify... Discovered by other means...	1

9941	Intuitive, easy and flawless. Kudos to the Dec, for once a state sponsor app is not a disaster! Just a pitty that this ain't a European app and every country makes it's own...	0
9942	This app in principle is a brilliant idea. I've had it for nearly a month no issues. In the last week the charge can't fall out of my battery fast enough and its causing my phone to restart a lot. I think other apps are crashing now too. I've had to uninstall it. Please fix and I will try again.	1
9943	Update 11.08.2020. Reinstalled. Ok so far. Worked fine but as reported elsewhere it isn't working now. The battery on the S7 went from full charge to dead in 2 hours or less . Usually it would last a whole day without charge. Deleted 10 Aug as waited 3 days for a fix and worried phone be damaged by over heating and not able to use phone	1
9944	Terrible app, keeps interfering with Bluetooth connection to my other devices, doesn't auto update and just in general is a pain to have on my phone.

10000	Extremely disappointed. More than 3 months since my initial feedback that the QR code scanning does not work on the Redmi 10x Pro phone and it remained unfixed after 3 new releases since then. All other QR code scanners work on this phone except the TraceTogether App. The developers just could not be bothered to fix this.	1
10001	the app makes the real physical Identity card useless, which is if u don't have a smart phone, u cannot enter into some premises which solely use this particular app. When facing phone or data issues u cannot even scan ur own IC. Very clever idea indeed.	1
10002	Very clean and simple app!	0
10003	The pin no appeared before I had time to write it down. I am 74 yo and my hands are affected by chemoradiotherapy and unsteady. 3 out of 4 of my close friends won't get this app. Too many issues with setting up. No wonder uptake is not as good as you want it to be.Your tech info is sparse for oldies. I'm so disappointed it is no better than months ago. What are " workouts" on a computer. What are " useful Notifications"? You have had time to make everything clearer for us. Pin no Please!	1
10004	Very very bad poor	1
10005	Big ? Is showing no update or registration kindly help	1
10006	Reading the permissions and the reasons provided this app goes against the international GDPR laws, that said also you do not need access to a users media to check for a root or jailbreak to validate the security patch on ones phone, that also being said in a country where Hauwei is a major partner to the telecoms and a very popular phone brand that has been stripped of googles security patches and is using EMUI a rooted enabled version. I love the concept just not the way it is implemented	1
10007	3rd time im reinstalling the app. First time it refuses to let me check in, second time it refuses to let me check out. Both instance i have perfect internet connectivity. Fix the app if you want more people to adopt. And these issues are on top of the battery drain, the disruptions to bluetooth devices connectivity and the spontaneous waking up of device (most irritating in the middle of the night when it detects the other trace together users in my household)	1
10008	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

10060	Downloading and using this app is a civic responsibility. Contrary to views expressed by conspiracy nuts and the fake news media, this is a good app, and it strikes a good balance between privacy and the need for public health officials to get data. It now incorporates a Linux Foundation sponsored open source project, which makes it even better, and the contact tracing more reliable. Apple and Google want to cut the government and public health officials out of pandemic response, which is dumb.	0

My wife is a government employed health care worker and even though I’ve been talking about this for months, she didn’t even know it was out there. A random search for “Covid” on the App Store is how I found it. \n\nYou need to make a bigger effort to inform people about this app, and educate them on how to install it.	1

I can confirm this but I think it's whenever the app logs a contact, the music lags. If I played it through the physical earphones there's no problem. So I'm guessing the Bluetooth connection has got something to do with it.	1

On Friday I got stopped while going to work because an officer was excited for this Tawakkalna and he asked me about it and when I said I have only my paper permission he didn't like my reply and started saying I should get.. It doesn't make sense to ask people about it when only certain people got chosen for it. This is my third day trying to register and it always asks me to try later.	1

10219	Downloaded on my phone fine, but my husband’s iPhone6 is not compatible. Tracking won’t work well when the app only works on newer phones - limits the number of people who can use it.	1

10225	No OTP received.	1
10226	Downloaded due to hearing of recent cases in my area in qld, was expecting the app to alert me to these cases and provide information about the pop up clinic nearby and the list of places those people have been where I could be at risk but the app provides no such information, even when I click on the news and updates link it shows very little information on the matter. Seems like a pretty important feature to have on an app with the ability to know my location and alert me to the risk.	1
10227	Got a notification to say i was in contact and had to isolate. Only problem was i had been in contact the 10th. First told of it the 23rd with 1day left to isolate. Its reliant on people updating the app with their test results and if they dont do that then nobody knows	1

10278	Latest update (3 Aug) has possibly caused battery issues. Updated the app yesterday (app now asks for location) and I've noticed today my battery is already below 50% half-way through the day when I normally get to the end of the day with 70-80% remaining. I'll keep monitoring it as Android can just have "battery drain days" so it's hard to say if it's this app's fault at this stage.	1

10297	I'm a first responder but deleted the app because of its bluetooth hogging and battery consumption issues, plus it seems to just stop working, especially after turning my phone into a pocket heater. I reckon this is exactly the sort of terribly optimised app we can expect from the government and as such it needs plenty of fixes before I reinstall it. Then of course there's the security side of things. Look at the government's track record with My Health and others being hacked, not good.	1
10298	Honestly this app is trash and uses up all my battery power in like half a day so like this app is garbage and i would like to speak to the manager about app optimization	1

10330	Radius alert section doesn't show my location. It was working fine on previous versions.	1
10331	Ok	0
10332	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

10362	I installed the app because I believe it will be useful in slowing down the spread of COVID 19. After a few days, I noticed that my phone was taking an unacceptably long time to load new email, search for products on Amazon or upload scores to the Golf Canada app. In fact, it was so slow that both the Amazon and Golf Canada apps stopped working. There were other operations that were affected by the slow down. I tried rebooting the phone several times, but there was no improvement. I finally deleted the app, rebooted the phone and now the performance is back to normal. My phone has 128GB of memory and I do not have very many apps installed, so it is not as though it is overloaded. I’m very disappointed!	1

10373	Good	0
10374	Please add daily statistics (last 24 hours) to the app too. Users will like to open the app on a daily basis to see a dynamic of the spreading. As it is now, with an aggregated statistics, it is not informative on the virus dynamic. So, very often, I (and I guess many others) don't open the app for few days as current aggregated statistics is not interesting.	1
10375	Working fine. An excellent tool to track the contacts of COVID19 positive and will definitely help the healthcare officials fight this virus with help of individuals in society.My concern is that Bluetooth remains permanently ON, user should be able to switch off when he is in home.	0

10379	All of a sudden ask to get camera permissions but there is no camera permission setting in the app permission settings. \nI have been using the app for a while without a problem, but now this is causing me to not want to go anywhere, because I need to type manually details.	1

10389	I can't register if my QID is expired (under renewal)! That shouldn't be an issue!!	1
10390	The recent 2.0 update seems to have done something to it's battery use. Judging from the feedback here, I'm not alone in noticing a marked increase in battery drain since the update. In my case, with Covidsafe on, the phone will no longer go on deep sleep/doze. It seems to have borked something with wakelocks. I adopted the app immediately on release and have repeatedly encouraged others to do the same, but in it's present state, I can no longer continue. One kludge I can think of is killing the process when not out and about, but that would require remembering to turn it back on again, which, let's face it, is a losing proposition.	1

10406	Great idea. Well done. No share option! Fail x 10!!!! I feel like the alert means nothing because it’s under used.  Please consider “sharing” as a big unavoidable button in the centre of the app. Give the job to a hungry startup and it will be done by tomorrow. No time for slow government decision processing this time. Good luck. I hope it spreads faster than fast. We all stand to benefit by widespread adoption. ??	1

10416	The idea of developing this app for public concern is good , but while implementing any application for public purpose, kindly look into all the possibilities of using app by the citizens without any hindrances, asof now the many citizens including me can't able to register the application becoz they are asking QID and it's expiry date, as I am on family visit visa I have my passport and visa ..it's my request kindly make an option in the app of putting passport number and it's expiry	0

You can improve this app by making a simple online test for the citizens and residents to clear their doubts ( whether they have covid-19 or not as some people regularly catch cold or fever ). This may be useful to clear misunderstandings.	0

So nice idea for an app but its not working.	1

10486	Hi, I'm now able to register my mobile #, several OTP codes arrived late. Last one just in time so I'm able to register. I just noticed that there are times when Im listening to music on my mobile that the music gets interrupted and then returns back to normal when using my Bluetooth earbuds. This started when I setup this App. Is this normal?	1
10487	Not working	1

10496	The app worked well but I noticed at times when I was out that no checks had been made. I did recieve an alert to isolate for 14 days which I did, yet on the 5th day into isolation I got another notification saying that I've been exposed and have to isolate for 14 days. I hadn't left to house, I didnt even leave my bedroom so I'm not sure how accurate this app is which is why I removed it.	1
10497	Uninstalling as it keeps telling me my phone number is invalid. I've tried three times. Now I just couldn't be bothered. Very unimpressed.	1
10498	Not support Huawei that without Google	1

10502	Very good App in Qatar	0
10503	Should have a function to detect version level between mobile device's and GooglePlay's. So we don't waste time re-updating our app when we encounter a corrupted QR code which directs us to do so.	1
10504	Seems like a waste of money and time for a country like Bangladesh. This modality will barely work in this country.	1
10505	Easy to set up	0
10506	I fully support the use of the app and I will for sure keep it, however, I keep getting notifications on my lockscreen but when I click on them the App says "Keine Meldungen". Why does this keep happening?	1
10507	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
10508	The apps will auto *disappear*. I've to check if the apps is running everyday. By the way I didn't turn off my Bluetooth. Pls help the resolve the issue. Thank you.	1

10526	This app wastes the battery life on my phone	1
10527	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
10528	Needs to be promoted more on Google Play Store, it only appears if the exact name is searched for i.e stopcovid ni. Can envisage problems for people who are not so tech savy	1

10549	The app is good but what about radius alert? is it correct information about cases???	1
10550	Most of the time the app shows blank and then QR code needs to be done. After uninstalling to reinstall the download keeps on saying pending. Worst app.	1

10555	Why Update notification On Daily basis??? Make A Perfect App Its A Government app make it premium App And need easy Access to everyone. Updated Your Maps/Radius Alert Situation on Hourly Basis. Need A More Work or a professional person to manage it properly .	1
10556	Can't register. The app won't accept our phone numbers. Dropped the leading zero and entered the rest of the number. Others in the family are having the same problem.	1
10557	Very good	0
10558	Good start.. please do research on Australia's Covidsafe app and try to get similar features and functionality and I pray you get the support from iatf to push widespread use.. we need more people installing this.. i also suggest to add features to help in other nations issues.. like the issue where public utility vehicles are being asked to record names of passengers.. maybe you can develop something like a qr checker for this?	0

10570	Please bring back the feature to search for locations and check in like how it's done on the SingPass app. This will speed up entry instead of making everyone cluster together to scan the QR code.	1
10571	Would not accept my phone number Says it is an invalid no	1
10572	The idea of the app is good, it loads and sets up easily but it used 10% of the phone battery in 2 hours. That was with WiFi and all other background apps turned off.	0
10573	An important initiative that becomes more effective the greater the take up. No major issues, just some minor bluethooth blips and a slight increase in battery drain but these are being addressed with the app updates.	1
10574	Haven't touched it since I downloaded it but it drains my battery and messes with my Bluetooth whether I'm in my car or walking with wireless earphones. If it wasn't the reason I could go out, I'd delete it.	1
10575	Stay safe use arogya setu.	0
10576	Good! IT Support very responsible.	0
10577	This app crashes a lot, and buggy. My location wasn't even valid	1

10583	Very useful this apps thanks!	0
10584	I just wish there would be a better way to know the app is working correctly than just a discrete notification, for instance stats about how long the application was on for the past couple of days or how long it's been deactivated when I'm reactivating it. I'm never certain it's not disabled by the OEM's battery optimization "service" and I don't check the app every day.	1

10593	5 stars. I'm enjoying the 1* reviews here though, most are either from people who are upset or doesn't let them spy on their neighbours (you have no right to know who has it) or the mind bending "I'm not signing up to that, it tracks my location", like to leave the review saying they you'll have already signed up for Google Play which totally tracks you all the time. Good app, well designed, all depends on high uptake so, like, download it for the win.	0

10616	This app impacts on my Bluetooth functionality too much. I'm using a pair of BT earbuds and had no issues with them until I start using Tracetogether App. Now the earbuds keeps getting disconnecting and reconnecting which frankly is getting on my nerve.	1
10617	Attempted to register and mobile number listing as invalid?? This is the same mobile number I have registered throughout varied state and fed government services (myGov etc). When I wasn't sure about signing up in first place, such a frustrating start doesn't encourage me to bother with this app. Sorry ScoMo I gave it a chance	1

10691	Simple. Unobtrusive. It just works	0
10692	Those saying they can\u2019t get their number recognised, have you tried leaving off the leading zero? Because the app has the +61 at the front this usually means you enter your phone number without the leading zero. I imagine they\u2019ve put the 61 there to ensure that only Australian numbers can participate, which is sensible. I left off the leading zero and got in straight away with no issues at all.   I think this app is a great initiative. I\u2019m not worried about the so called problems of authorities knowing where I am. They can already do that anyway through the phone\u2019s location service and through the gps on my car. This is designed for better tracing of who you happen to be around in the shops or at work or wherever, to meet the response to the virus, so I\u2019ll support it.	0
10693	Edit: Thank you for the feedback. Now it works. Original: Cause 4000, something went wrong http status 901 + a stack trace when you click details, amazing user friendly interface. Thank you very much. Uninstalled.	0

10697	Make things easier. Just make sure you receive an SMS before you download this app. Otherwise, it will not work	0
10698	I input the correct particulars, but they were flagged as being in error. Please help.	1
10699	3 people in my house have been using this app from when it was released. 2 of them tested positive and inputted their test results into the app however after more than 24 hours I haven't received an exposure warning on my app?	1
10700	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
10701	Works fine, minimal impact on battery life.	0

10783	This app would be more useful if it contains guidance to a potential positive patient about health facility for screening near him based on his location. It should also contain update on availability of isolation facility or ventilator etc	1

10786	Good app	0
10787	I installed this app as soon as possible, it works fine while I'm home or at the local shop or visiting family, but as soon as I venture to any shopping centre, which is the only place I go that I may be in contact with an infected person, the bluetooth cuts out every time, really it's not worth having on my phone.	0
10788	I am unable to register myself, tried many times. The app kept asking me to validate my NRIC number.	1

10803	A lot of people around Australia have suffered because of the lockdowns and because of COVID. Please consider you community and download this app. If you use google maps or Uber or credit cards, the government already knows where you are. It will let you know if you\u2019ve come into contact with some one who has COVID. You can delete it again whenever you want. Let\u2019s get back on track.	0

10807	Very secure and private system	0
10808	Sometimes I forget to turn Bluetooth back on again after I have turned it off. I think it would be good if the app sent me an SMS or email reminder eg hourly to turn Bluetooth on again if I have forgotten to turn Bluetooth on again. Cheers.	1
10809	Not accurate with the infected areas because one of my neighbor got infected 2 weeks ago but it's still showing that my area is a safe zone. Rest information is good to know about.	1

10816	The app keeps deactivating on its own and you need to go back into the app. It keeps saying set up is incomplete when I have already gotten it done.	1
10817	When first released this app didn't have any issues that concerned me. A subsequent update has resulted in it causing significant battery drain though, with the app now the largest consumer of my phone's battery, using more battery each day than an hour+ of Web browsing.	1
10818	It would be better if it uses less of my battery	1

10829	its stupid, as students cannot do anyting as NRIC below 17 cannot then student pass is for the foreigners then Singaporean below 17 do what ? cannot sign up ?	1
10830	This app is broken. It only shows quarantine center locations in radius alert. It gives you a false sense of safety that you are in a safe zone. However I can personally attest that there were 4 cases in my back street which the app didn't show. The data is not updated in realtime.	1
10831	Good	0
10832	No point in using this. Except to drain battery with having both Bluetooth and GPS on always. I am not going to spend 75% of my battery to this app every day. Might inform when I might have got too close to infected person carrying the same app. Completely pointless unless every single human had separate device to do this.	1

I don't want to uninstall because of what it does but why have it if my phone is going to turn off anytime I leave the house or have to constantly charge my phone. Is this just my phone or has this got something to do with the app? Never happened before for any app	1

10851	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

Now I need to do a force stop through phone settings to close the app. With working from home as the norm, it can be days before I leave the house. Alternatively, allow users to setup a schedule to on and off. Or if the use of GPS is not a privacy issue, detect that the user has left a certain area and switch it on. Google maps now allows a user to specify home location.	1

It's designed to transfer data. Even though there is is improvements with security with Bluetooth I still wouldn't trust it. BLUETOOTH IS EASILY HACKABLE!	1

11014	As expected like other the govt apps and websites. Poor guys, even I can do better job than this ðŸ™‚	1
11015	Glad to hear contacts have been discovered through the app and it is showing value. The weekend where Google's Play Services update started to cause the app to quickly drain batteries was not fun but it was fixed quickly and has worked perfectly again since.	0
11016	I would like to install the app on my phone but my operating system is too old (Android 5.1.1) and I am not prepared to buy a new phone just to install the app. The government should of designed an app to work on older and newer versions.	1
11017	I live with an infected person who is marked in the app for 4 days in a shared apartment, we both have this app installed and Bluetooth turned and so on but I still didn't get any notifications. Also, in the past I got notifications for 10 consecutive days about risky encounters but I was just at my home and didn't meet any people. For me it just doesn't work properly therefore I don't see any real benefits using it.	1

11023	Currently I'm working in a construction project and I kept my Bluetooth always on, although I received a notification that says my trace together app is working well but still my history is zero for last 14 days. What's the issue..?	1
11024	Unable to install latest version. Previous versions caused every other update to fail due to no connection.	1
11025	I type my ic no. correctly and yet they state that its wrong??????	1
11026	The SafeEntry Check-In tab which you have added, it would be good if you also add a QR Code Scan function so that we do not have to use another App to scan.	1

11032	Just download the app... due to mandatory soon. Unfortunately stuck at the OTP. If thd App is not ready for the public it should not be implemented island wide. I'm wling to support the trace togetacticity but your app really not ready for the whole public. Please look into it immediately.	1
11033	Great Initiative! Hopefully it will help to control corona pandemic.	0
11034	Good	0
11035	Love the new QR code scanner. The app saves your last check in location, making check out a breeze. Only have 4 star as the battery drain is still quite heavy.	1
11036	Keeps showing invalid safe entry qr code, but other qr scanner app works fine.	1
11037	I am unable to sign up. "Something went wrong" keeps popping up all the time. Please fix it. It was quite the hassle, using this application.	1
11038	Stopped working and I can't get it to work again.	1
11039	Very effective	0
11040	Ok	0
11041	If you're having the issue of it saying your number is invalid, try the following: turn off Wi-Fi (this worked for me), or reset the app (worked for my friend).	1
11042	It took me 10 seconds to install it and it is running.	0

11046	Will not accept my mobile number. I have tried with and without the 0. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still won't accept my number. Not sure if this is an issue with certain phones - I own a Nokia. Won't get a great uptake if it says your number is invalid when had the same number for 25 years.	1
11047	Very usefull app	1
11048	Now getting "connected to null - disconnected from null" notifications constantly. If I force app closed, those connection notifications go away. Covid safe can't even update itself! If you want this to succeed you need to fix all the issues. Lift your game government!	1

11082	As expected.	1
11083	A great idea for Australia. Regardless of efficiency why not have this app open all the time?  If I have been near a person who is Wuhan positive I want to know and I want to know that other people will be told about me. It is a new app and they all need bedding in. Note that every app in the world is constantly refined so give Australia and our Government a break and keep it on!	0
11084	Dear sir I came back India to Kuwait sinsce 9months after my shlonik app in Kuwait air port register nber not working app login also not opening asking OTP the registration sim nber is alloted to some one person I can ihave to log in with new nber please solve this pblm sir	1

11101	Have been trying to download this app for the past 3 hours.	1
11102	This app is very informative and very helpful. I do recommend that everyone should use this app and help the government in contact tracing.. Though it would be much better and if it is possible to display the per city and the actual cases on the Map	0
11103	Good app	0
11104	Ur status and unwanted contact with infected person tell u what to do next.	1
11105	Why in my application says still under quarantine. My barcode is still yellow. But I'm already finished in my test and it says negative. And I already call for maintenance. Always telling me to wait for update.	1
11106	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
11107	So, I had received SMS that I have been selected. Installed it. I HAD previously logged in without any problem. Now that I need to request for permit the APP has decided not to work. Trying to Login for last 3 hours. *Rating given is arbitrary*	1
11108	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
11109	Crash ! Please Update this App.	1
11110	It takes way too long to deliver the message, I finally got it using this app though it took over 12hrs\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f	1

11115	Love it	0
11116	Can we have the app scan the safe entry QR code instead of letting others scan me. Its redundant to have my nric barcode on app when I already have it in my wallet. Preferably I would like to have a very close range bluetooth or nfc where I can tap in & tap out using the app.	1

But.... On the old phone we can uninstall and reinstall to the old phone only. The OTP will not deliver if we try to install to new phone.	1

11147	I didn't enjoy the app. As no details were given about the number of new cases in every county. I posted nearly 40 times that I had no symptoms. I received a response saying Great to hear today. The first app that I thought effectively carried out tracking and testing and tracing of existing cases.	1

11153	Downloaded the Covid Tracker app as soon as it was launched & it seemed to be working fine with no issues until this weekend when my battery drained down from fully charged to 3% in a couple of hours although I hadn't been using my phone. I heard there was a problem with the app so deleted it but just reinstalled it having heard that the app had been updated yesterday & the battery issue was now resolved. Strangely enough when I reinstalled the app the date of the last update is July...	1

11199	No option to turn the app off for some time. Would like to turn it off while at home playing some games and this app makes trouble by running in the background. No big ram usage however always on notification, Bluetooth and background running memory with no option to turn it off manually is a negative. But overall support the idea	1

11211	Why does this app need to have permission access with Bluetooth every "live scan"? Hackers can hack phones through it (called "bluebugging"). I feel it is an intrusive app.	1
11212	I received a message from SALT recommending that I download the SwissCovid App. \n\nThe message is VERY poorly written (in English).\n\nThe first line says:\n\n“The FOPH’s SwissCovid app informs you if you have been in close contact with an infected person.”\n\nI missed the “if” the first few times I read it and thought I had been in contact with someone who had tested positive.\n\nThe first line of the message should be rewritten to avoid other people misunderstanding like I did.	1

11270	The app drains too much battery! Bluetooth uses the microwave frequency spectrum in the range of 2.4 GHz to 2.4835 GHz, the same as the microwave oven. Can you be sure it's safe for our health in prolonged usage? Telco do have location records which you can track as well. If this App is as good as you claimed, why do you think Safe Entry was created? To complement or compensate this App?

11279	Stupid update. can u not remind every freaking time need to update and remind once for a day. annoying each freaking time ask to update Dear developer, u want me to update while i am outside. i will update them when at home USING WIFI (auto update). just today i need go many places and every place got ur safe entry. can you not wait? or will you pay my phone bill to update? Can you not be like other app where if update is needed, it just remind ONCE PER DAY AND NOT EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN APP	1
11280	This review helpful for people	0
11281	I hope there is an option of switching off the app or the bluetooth when we are just at home..cause it really drains the battery.	1

11291	Automatically turns my Bluetooth and wifi ON, it consumes battery. Concerns regarding privacy issues as the app asks permission to your media files.	1
11292	Annoying, it won't recognise my phone number, tried it every possible way without success. I was already on the fence on the privacy issue, now I'll just give up if it doesn't work	1
11293	Simple and easy to register (after the 6pm start). Moved to Samsung setting to exempt app from low battery settings. For the time they had to set up, well done.	0
11294	Good	0
11295	Good	0
11296	Works fine. But why not make it completely anonymous so people with privacy concerns would also download it. Could have easily been an app that gave a unique ID and then sent sent out notifications to other unique id"s that were within range if there was an issue. Unfortunately many people are not downloading this app for this reason. A shame really because it could have really helped if the government listened to those with concerns.	0

11299	You need to make the app auto rotate on screen. Bcos it's fixed and some of my screen is cracked I'm unable to input all of my information so the app is useless to me	1

11311	When you register for the app, the system will send you an OTP. The first OTP regardless if you typed in correctly or not will fail. Only on second OTP the registration will pass. Entering your birth and NRIC issue date, regardless of what year you typed in, it will default to "1970" after you accept it. It is only when you scroll to your birth year or NRIC issue year manually, then it will be correct. Do you guys check your work? This will cause massive data entry errors on your app.	1
11312	Need to report problem: any time I open the app it says 'tracing is not active so this app will not work' before switching to active once opened. The app says I can close it and it will remain active but this doesn't seem to be the case (as evident when I close and re-open it). I hope this is picked up as I couldn't see anywhere to report issues	1

11318	Battery drain, caused device to overheat. Uninstalled.	1
11319	Very good, easy to install. App is in English, I assume it detects your phone settings when being installed. If you switch your phone off, I'm guessing you need to remember to reactivate the app each time. This perhaps should be explained during the download process. Otherwise, looks great so far!	0

11324	This is a very good app protect us against the covid-19. It will inform us when we come in contact with a corona positive person. we should help the government to protect us against the corona virus and thanks for creating this and i will recommend you to not to listen to the bad reviews and keep going !!â˜ºâ˜ºðŸ‘�ðŸ‘�ðŸ‘�ðŸ‘�	0

11332	Seems to be using excessive amount of battery. Update 28/08/20 Since the software fix my phone battery usage has returned to normal. Also with the last app update it is much better more information and you can now be informed re Covid 19 status in the country and your county. Much improved. Well done ??. Keep it up.	1

This went on again and again until I uninstall this app. I would very much like to install this app to help but I cannot go without my music. Battery also drain extremely fast. I usually charge my phone once a day but after installation, I need to charge 2 to 3 times a day.	1
11353	The app keeps telling that 'exceeded code of activation'. What does this mean? What should I do?	1
11354	Much more observations	0
11355	Good	0
11356	Very informative, useful and up to date. Can also add recently developed SOP's so we know what to implement. There is a lot you can share and do with this app like adding travel advice, detailed list of areas with in a city that are safe or should be avoided etc.	0
11357	App works well, however misses the big opportunity by not integrating the Apple/Google API. Switched over to Rippl instead to ensure my privacy.	0
11358	WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE OTHER OPTION FOR INPUT INFORMATION LIKE PASSPORT NO OR VISA NO ATLEAST PEOPLE ON VISIT OR OTHER VISAS CAN CONNECT INSTEAD OF NOT HAVING EMIRATES ID	1
11359	An excellent help during this corona time.	0
11360	This app shows a totally misleading and inaccurate results vis a vis the radius alert. As far as the the data regarding infected cases is concerned, you can get the same from other reliable resources as well. Further, it keeps on crashing and fails to start. So there is no use of this app and doesn't serve the purpose it was intended for. Therefore, uninstalling it.	1

11385	Awesome/ user friendly, convenient and case Sensitive to tap safe entry. Can saved safe entry QR for frequent visit places.	0
11386	Since I installed the app I need to charge my battery already in the middle of the day (instead of just reaching bedtime).	1
11387	It really zaps the battery like crazy... coupled with the bt issue that I've read about (which I have not experienced yet). I honestly think this is a fail, am going to uninstall and wait till the product improves and you wonder why the take up rate is less than expected. This is meant to aid in the tracing efforts with minimum inconvenience to the user. Batt and BT, these are the most basic needs of most smart phone users. Please improve on this asap.	1
11388	First time user, my email won’t work, the codes don’t work. No idea what to do. Not going to bother.	1
11389	Sucks!!	1
11390	What's the point of tracing with bluetooth on and consistently needing to run it in the background? Having bluetooth on without using is prone to hacking. Why don't you guys use Google's geo tagging capability and not into some old school methods?	1
11391	The app drains too much battery! Bluetooth uses the microwave frequency spectrum in the range of 2.4 GHz to 2.4835 GHz, the same as the microwave oven. Can you be sure it's safe for our health in prolonged usage? Telco do have location records which you can track as well. If this App is as good as you claimed, why do you think Safe Entry was created? To complement or compensate this App? Why do you think so little people installed, not to mention those who uninstall right after? Bad experience..	1

11407	Great app, would be an eye-opening feature if it displayed how many other individuals (with the app) that you came in contact with during the day. Would also be interesting if the Bluetooth (close contact) feature shared this number of contacts between app users and plotted it on a web graph to further demonstrate how the virus can spread.	0

11414	This app is exceptionally hard on battery usage. I currently have to fully recharge my phone twice a day!!	1
11415	It interferes with all my bluetooth devices. Cannot listen to songs nor watch videos. It will cause my videos and songs to stop abruptly for 30s to a min. But once uninstalled, my songs and videos plays normally.	1

11417	I can't use or register ehtrazz app	1
11418	I've tried downloading the app but unsuccessfull.	1
11419	Covid tracing apps should be very low on battery use. I have used and tested multipe national apps, and the French tous anti covid is the single app that drains the battery, making it very undesirable for average public to use. Seconds critique is that it needs manual activation. Most other apps automatically activate once Bluetooth is on. Why force the user to open the app and activate? I like the statistics page and useful links.	1

11486	This app is so bad and I cannot emphasize that enough. People are dying because of this disease and the developers of this application think it's funny to make a fake tracking app. How is it possible to put a tracker on a virus, it's only a bunch of cells. So disappointed.	1

11489	Doesn't work on iphone11 not sure if because it needs internet connection to scan QR code, but if it does I wonder why that option wasnt given. Should allow you to scan and just update your profile when internet connection is available. Will keep it in my phone for a while and update it but if it still doesnt work in a week or 2 after updates will remove it as its just pointless to have it in my phone and can't use it	1

11493	Very intuitive app that will hopefully improve the contact tracing process. Would be nice if I could manually record daily temperature for historical analysis. It uses Bluetooth so it will be interesting to see if it has an effect on battery usage. The more people that have the app the safer we all are. Stay safe folks	0
11494	The update description is "bug fixes". Seriously. Changelog link or release notes please? You're expecting trust here. Show some. You also continue to violate open source licenses and fail to release source. I reluctantly installed this in the hope you could do better. Show me you can.	1

With Bluetooth always on, every time I open the app it says tracing not active and then a second later it says tracing active. Also when I turn off the Bluetooth I do not get the error message and red icon at top of screen on Moto 6e (Works fine on Samsung J3)	0

11519	Latest up date with a QR scanner but can't even scan any... keep saying not a QR code. Headache using it. Why did you take away to barcode which link to our infor ? At least we cannot scan QR and that can be scan by the duty security for safe entry and we don't have to rush into wallet to find IC for scanning	1
11520	I've only just downloaded the app, and am rating it high so that more people can see this app, download it and stay safe. Have seen some negative reviews about this thing massacring battery life, and I do hope that gets fixed, but props to the government for doing this for us. They're trying their hardest, and I respect it.	1
11521	The app won't stay open or let me register. It keeps closing even though I have granted access to everything. I never leave the house except to grocery shop and today I couldn't because app doesn't work for me.	1
11522	BATT drainer. And it defeat the purpose of using this app unless every single person in SG is using it as well, otherwise.. its pointless.. but nevertheless.. good initiative though..	1
11523	The application would close on its own. I once tried to keep this app open and not switch to anything else and once my mobile go into standby mode, it's closed and I have to relaunch again. Edit: Thx 4 reply. Oppo user > Battery >Energy Saver> Trace> Disable Background Freeze, Abnormal Apps Optimisation, Doze. Hope this helps and maybe update the app for the front page so users will instantly know what to look for in their mobile? I didn't know until I start digging around my settings.	1

11527	App pretty much destroyed my battery. Overheated my phone and drained it constantly. Cleared my cache and uninstalled the app it didn't work. Have to send it away for repairs. Considering the purpose of the app not only disappointing but honestly ridiculous	1

11533	Good initiative...	0
11534	The app told me of a possible match of an infected person in Pasta Basta in Ramat Gan where Iwas supposed to have been. When I ask to show this location on the map and open it, the map shows a wrong location as I know for a fact that there is no Pasta Basta in that location. The developers need to add a way for individuals to edit and correct location or at least to mention that the place mentioned does not exist there.	1

11547	bug in app. when registering nric, cannot type to change year 1970 for date of birth. After that cannot proceed as it erroneously said my NRIC was not valid	1
11548	Very easy and convenient to check in and out just add to favourites.	1
11549	Stooped working and the status is unknown, when asking for permissions it says "something went wrong". Please fix ASAP	1
11550	Great app considering it may actually save your life! The fact that app stores so little data compared to lots of other apps, data is stored locally on your phone, government needs your consent to upload your data to server and privacy is protected legislation means the risk of data loss/loss of privacy is minimal. In fact lots of other apps upload lot more data about u to servers on the internet without you knowing! Source code has been released &does what ithey claims. See COVIDSafe help	0
11551	After keying my ic etc cannot proceed further	1
11552	This app didn't show I-10 cases cause of to many cases I-10 is locked and this didn't show any single case in I-10. This is rediculous. You have to update this thing otherwise this app is just a garbage.	1
11553	Simple. Works.	0
11554	Note:Bluetooth tends to drain phone battery if used for long periods on top other apps Areas of improvement: perhaps the check in and check out function for safe entry can be incorporated so we can see existing check in locations and allow us to via app scan to check in. N remotely check out without needing to rescan	1
11555	as of now, this is a better version that the previous one but hope the links works better and more accurate, used the user ids instead the hastag numbers because... hirap kaya intindihin, and looking forward na even sa links indicated health stats. salamat and more power sa developer.	0

11604	In a country that relies on passed down smart phones to its very disappointing and limiting that this necessary app won’t run on iPhone 5 (can’t be upgraded from iOS 12 to iOS 13), which is still an effective smart phone. \n\nThe developers need to look at a way to make it available on iOS 12	1
11605	Quick way to have everyone uninstall this. "Only needs bluetooth to run" \ud83d\udc4eNot anymore, was already battery killer now 'gps' required also!? Wait for the conspiracy fire on this update.	1

11607	* Solution After the last update it stopped working in my phone "your phone is rooted" even though it's not, then I found out the app interfere with a different app in my phone, as soon I uninstall the other app, it works again.

11639	no issue, just the standard COVID app that use google service which anonymously share a unique UID which is deleted 14 days later. for the conspirationist : no it's not a limitation of your liberty ... and no they are not spying on you ... they don't give a flying F about you. but if you are positive, i register you as a "paranoid bioterrorist" nothing to hide, specially if i was COVID positive i would gladly register to the app as such and protect other users of the app,	0

11642	Have tried IT, Fr and DE Corona Apps - this one is the best. Puts responsibility with the citizen to inform gov and protect themselves and societies.	0
11643	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

11675	No sync with Google API Contact Tracing	1
11676	Keeps stopping for no reason. Reinstalling it or clearing the application data allows it to respawn but it will go down again a few days later. It seems problems are linked to accessing the Bluetooth stack as when BT is turned off the app will work again. But it will crash as soon as I want to reactivate it with BT turned back on. Frustrating.	1

Please do your logistics proper before rolling your nonsense out. If you can't do a proper app then do not roll it out. If you can't have enough tokens, stop making Trace Together compulsory. Seriously dumb!	1
11707	It dose not work	1

11729	Please ask telecom operators to send notifications to all users to download and install the app. Wide spread usage is required to get the full benefits. \n\nSupermarkets  may be instructed to let in customers with smartphones to have this app mandatorily.

11776	I think it's important app to have it in this current situation. But whenever am trying to register pop up coming as "Unfortunately Ehteraz has stopped".sometimes it's going to another page where I put mobile number,ID number n exp but after tat when I put OTP it's showing "Error in registering ". Till now I uninstall n again installed more than 10 times. Checked settings of my mobile. How to fix this issue?	0
11777	App is still running and not downloading...	1
11778	This site is uselesd for daily infections /deaths check - it is always 24 hr behind and another bluff depicting govt cash spent for a worthwhile cause.	1
11779	Very bad app I'm crazy every time not open this app how to open	1
11780	I have had this app since the beginning. I've had no problems, maybe a bit more battery use. Happy to help and everyone else should help too!!!!	0
11781	Drains battery like nuts!	1
11782	Registration is easy. For those complaining, didn't you read that you need to register after 6pm?? As for dropping the "0", that's the standard way of entering a mobile number using the international format. It's a wonder some can answer their phone!	0
11783	very bad... tried creating an account using my ic but it says that 15 year olds can't have an ic and that i can only register when i'm 17 years old but yet the givernment asked me to register and get an ic. when i tried creating with a student pass i can't cause im not a foreigner? so how exactly am i supposed to make an account to use my token?	1
11784	Good	0
11785	You need to make the app auto rotate on screen. Bcos it's fixed and some of my screen is cracked I'm unable to input all of my information so the app is useless to me	1
11786	This app is incredibly unstable. The codes I scan are apparently invalid, yet scanning them from my browser works perfectly! You also have to uninstall the app to change your phone number! Don't use this app, your browser is better for SafeEntry.	1
11787	installe ????? ??	0
11788	Very good application 	0
11789	This app has caused unusual behavior to my Oppo Reno 12. The Notification sound activated very frequently and the icons shown top of my phone blinks even after Bluetooth was turned off. After running scan via Phone Manager app, then only my phone back as normal. Please check the app compatibility.	1
11790	Was force to download this app.. such a waste of space and battery .. hate it so much.	1
11791	Had the app installed since early July. In the last week my new phone was being drained with battery power and would have to charge it twice a day. Along with that the screen would heat up, this really annoyed me so I got rid of the app off my phone and immediately the battery power improved. I will not use this app again until I know for certain that it will not harm my phone and that the proof is shown that these major problems have been resolved completely.	1
11792	Now what happened this app . Showing something went wrong. Please try after sometime........	1
11793	Nice	0
11794	I couldn't request any passes through it. I dont really know what is it for if I can't request passes.	1
11795	It's a Dumb App, a 10 yr old can point out the Flaws in it. It's a pathetic one.	1
11796	From 70 % battery to 23% in less than 2 hours and I've not even been using my phone.. no way u should download the app unless u want it connected to ur charger all day.	1
11797	This app is just stealing your data	1

11820	Now this application has become useless dont install it..	1
11821	I downloaded after the latest update. Whenever I enter my NRIC details, a message comes - " Temporarily unavailable please try again later" I don't know how to fix it because without the details the app doesn't scan.	1
11822	The app isn't loading after giving phone number, and the safe or unsafe option isn't showing.	1
11823	This app caused a lot of issues with my phone. Other apps started to freeze and there was a delay in opening things. I've now uninstalled this app and my phone is back to normal. Selfishly, I won't be downloading it again until fixed.	1
11824	Very good.	0

11827	I installed app on IPhone 7. Bluetooth drains my phones battery so I don't always keep it on. When I turn on app,it says app is active even though my Bluetooth is off. \nApps check phone status all the time to work properly. This COVID app doesn't. At least not in my phone.\n\nSo, if I forget to turn on Bluetooth before I leave the house, the App is useless.	1

11844	Negligible battery drain eventhough I have it on all the time to keep me safe from Covid-19. Well-designed and user-friendly app which exploits advanced technologies.	0

11859	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0
11860	Not.useful.at all	1
11861	Am going to have to uninstall it is draining my battery too much.	1
11862	Very bad	1
11863	I think the Australian government is doing a fantastic job in the control of and response to covid-19. In this app we see the first real fail. The app does not sufficiently protect privacy. Google and Apple have worked together to produce an app which is completely anonymous and does not provide information to be stored on a government server. Thus this requirement can be easily met with pre-existing technology which makes me suspicious as to why the Australian government is not providing it.	0
11864	Your aarogya Setu app fake e-pass not ready	1
11865	Very bad	1
11866	It says "contact tracing" service is currently unavailable because of permissions. When I go to edit the permissions, it says "this app is not requesting any permissions?? Any idea?.	0

11881	Ever since I updated the apps and the logo change to red color ( from blue) I can never get pass the NRIC validation. It is as though the apps know my ID better than me who had been using it for 40 years? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 What a ridiculous and unreliable update. 15th Sept Register success after a update on the app.	1

11884	please fix it, app always crash	1
11885	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
11886	Don't understand why the app required me to input issue date of NRIC, which meant having to search for the physical card. If you want people to use the app, only collect necessary info for contact tracing. Minimize the steps users must go through for a higher sign up/retention rate.	1
11887	Why is it forced on the people?	1

11892	1) Open the app, 2) tap a button and 3) point at the QR code. So easy.\nOnly improvement would be to default to the Record Visit screen (instead is the Dashboard) so step 2 is removed. Because that’s what we use the most.	0

11902	I am reminded on at least a daily basis to turn on my Bluetooth even though my Bluetooth is always on. The reminders are frustrating and I wonder if it is working at all. As it appears to not be working then I cannot rely on it to keep me safe and is useless. Therefore I give it a one star.	1
11903	The app was initially working fine. Just now the system was updated on my Redmi note 8PRO phone and Ehteraz app has stopped working.	1

11919	Hello, Can I ask for help how to fix this TraceTogether app before I can use it and now its says: Temporarily Unavailable We're really sorry. Please try again later. I tried several times to clear cache my phone, restart my phone, OFF and ON the data again, tried for how many days but still the same issue. Seeking for your kind assistance. Thank you.	1
11920	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
11921	I have problems last 2-3 weeks, always ask registration when open ehteraz, then exceed activation number, call 109 more than 6 times, follow all recommendation, problem still not solved, can't go to shopping, clinic, mall , mosque, in few weeks need to go back to office , don't know what to do , pls .. pls..fix the problem , or at least don't limit activation number, till problem is solved, I am using samsung galaxy 10, ehteraz is good tool but need to fix the bugs,	1
11922	Tried downloading to a samsung note 9 running latest OS yesterday. Told me " app will be downloaded soon" - Nothing happened, tried again a few hours later, same thing. And again today, same message. I guess a waiting list is nothing new for the HSE though...	0

11925	Really good one & usefull	0
11926	Why need to get access to media files.. it violates privacy.. I think its not relevant to give access to files and has nothing to do in combatting covid-19.	1
11927	The app doesn't work	1
11928	Keeps saying my phone number is invalid when I try to register.	1
11929	Useless	1
11930	Too easy to accidentally disable or remove when in use or it crashes (either way you think it's working but it's not) also had to uninstall and reinstall because "push notifications" refused to activate. Would be nice too to be told someone near you has the app up and running otherwise what's the point? btw had no problems prior to last update!	1
11931	It's too sensitive for detecting people, who are actually far away (more than 5-6meter away)	1

11947	Incredible job.thanks ksa	0
11948	Does what it should, and with a great minimalistic UI. Love that the 'little dev company' has proven the Big Four wrong!	0
11949	Had to uninstall the app before the weekend. my battery was dying in a matter of a couple of hours and my phone was overheating. am not sure if the issue has been fixed but I am reluctant to install again until I know for sure it has been fixed. it was great while it worked.	1
11950	When ever I downloaded TraceTogether it shows Waiting for Downloading any problem needs help	1
11951	It would be better if it uses less of my battery	1
11952	Good	0
11953	After using for a week and experiencing significant battery drain I have chosen to remove the app. After being fully charged at 7am using my phone for 24min (on screen time) the COVID-19 tracker accounted for 63% of my phones battery usage over a 5 hours, leaving me at 50%.\n\nThe app is a wonderful concept but I am not willing to put up with the effects on my battery life while waiting for mass adoption.	1
11954	It's awesome	0
11955	It's not proceeding further post updating my mobile number. It's not actually helpful	1
11956	StaySafe is a great app, simple and very easy to use. Thanks to the developers who dedicated their time in doing this kind of app.	0
11957	Facing similar issues as the others described. The app causes issues with other paired devices. However, I think this app has a bigger priority than our other devices for this period of time.	1

11959	Csnnot scan	1
11960	It works fine!	0
11961	After providing mobile number for verifications, the words \u2018wrong number?\u2019 shows up. These words wrongly send the message to people that they\u2019ve entered the wrong number but it\u2019s only asking if you\u2019ve entered wrong number. This needs to be changed to \u2018didn\u2019t receive code?\u2019   I had to explain that to someone so that may be why people are thinking they can\u2019t verify their number. If you receive a code it means your phone number is verified.	1
11962	Great idea but if a person with confirmed covid19 should be self isolating by law so will they have the app and take it out and about with them	0
11963	Hi Tech Gov Can this app work on Huawei Mate 30 series?	1
11964	The app continuously becomes inactive in the background without any notification to fix it. It appears this has something to do with the battery optimisation settings, which switches off when I exit the app. The app also seems to be killing my battery despite the fact the app being inactive 99% of the time. Meaning this app cannot collect any data to stop the spread of covid-19. This app is a good idea but the execution is terrible and extremely buggy. I have uninstalled until it's fixed.	1

11984	No commot	1
11985	Apart from using your phones battery, I don't know what else this app is good for? It hasn't proven to be helpful in tracking any contacts that human contact tracers haven't found.	1
11986	This app will reduce death and serious disease in the community. Like all apps this has a small privacy risks but, unlike most apps that people don't think twice before downloading, the benefits (good contact tracing) are great and the risks are tiny.	1
11987	Very useful	0
11988	I couldnt register i tired many times	1
11989	Please tell me the reason of "Something went wrong, please try again later". Everytime I ask for a permission I receive this message. Now how could I go out and get food for myself on the second day of Eid please tell me ?	1
11990	It is one of the stupid app because it is not shown the nearest affected people	1
11991	The app is excellent in my opinion considering the purpose behind this app. It fulfills the goal and it is simple to use. I see comments about look and feel, and being user friendly. Come on guys, this app is to help contain a situation and beat a pandemic, not to a lifestyle thing. There are some security concerns that the ministry is working on to fix.	0
11992	Drains my battery. Been doing so for days with no updates. Had to uninstall	1
11993	As an operational police officer, I look forward to carrying my phone with me all the time and feel a peace of mind knowing I am protected, provided everyone else is carrying the app	1

11995	Very good	0
11996	The map you have given in this application The name of the affected area and Number should be mentioned. This will give a lot of Goods So that it can be safe for him and the area.	1
11997	Totally useless. Constantly "no data, check internet connection "	1
11998	In the Covid tracing section of the app it says to enable contact tracing you need to upgrade to the latest version of Google play services, when I click on check on upgrade it says Google exposure notifications API not available on this device yet. What does this mean? I have a android smartphone with an up to date version of android and Google play services. What is the issue?	1
11999	GOOD	0
12000	An independent review has found that the privacy risks associated with the app have been addressed and that it is likely to help reduce the spread of the virus.  Sharing tokens/beacons with other devices that can later be linked back together as a chain is the best way to track contact and respect privacy.	0

12025	Works as advertised. Data stays in the device until you personally authorise upload of information. Can't fault this app to help get us back to normal life. Contrary to what some are saying, it had almost zero effect on battery. I can only assume that people complaining about battery are trying to push their barrow to stop other people using the app.	1

12031	Can the developers of this app please confirm when the battery drain issue will be fixed? I will have no option but to uninstall (reluctantly) if this problem persists. Contact with developers. Told to uninstall and download again. Battery drain is still as bad.	1
12032	Setting up my profile and it says "Validation failed" on my NRIC. Means what all this while my NRIC is fake????	1

12071	Unfortunately i had to delete the App today my phone started running hot ever since i downloaded it but today my phone started to badly overheat and started warning me that the covid app was using too much battery, and getting cpu usage warnings. Also the graph in the app is next to useless and no way to compare previous days figures i get better stats from Google. After deletion my phone is working perfect again and not melting in my pocket.

12115	Easy	0
12116	Many times when using the safe entry option I get an error saying not a valid QR code. But if I switch to my phone camera it works perfectly. So there is some problem with the QR scanning on some codes. Also many times I scan a code and the app just gets stuck with spinning blue circle. This seems to happen a lot when I've done safe entry once and then do it again for a second place soon after (eg first safe entry is a mall, second safe entry is a shop within the mall). App not really up to standard at the moment because of these problems, and I am sure it's the app only as using phone camera and web-based safe entry works fine.	1

12133	Everything works well with the app for contact tracing but having the option to put when you got to a place AND when you left would be good and people would probably be more likely to keep trace of that rather than putting it in the details section.	0

12143	I understand the importance of this app to get the COVID outbreak under control, and am happy to install it (well it's mandatory), but it's too intrusive for a contact tracing app. It's not logical that an app to track locations would require access to make calls, as well as to the phone gallery/storage. Puts an insane amount of strain on the phone resources including the battery leading to overheating, and significantly quick power drain.	0

12154	Very convenient to create the attestations. They are stored locally, too and deleted automatically after a certain time to avoid clutter. My only wish is that the app automatically activates itself once the phone comes out of airplane mode or after Bluetooth is turned back on.	0

12185	I appreciate the use of technology to combat this pandemic. But the implementation is nothing near to perfect. My app status still stays yellow even though, I finish quarantine last week. Follow up calls to 109/16000 is of little help. I tried to clean data, reinstall app etc, finally to exceed my registration limitation. I then had to use a diff no: to register again as 109 cannot reset my count. I cannot join my job & can't go out due to this. Hope tech team can iron out issues soon	1

12198	Battery consume too high	1
12199	Simple installation. Those who got the invalid phone number message (like I did) were trying to register before 6pm. Worked fine after that. This app makes sense and will help to protect me, my family, the community and our health workers, as well as speeding up our return to normal life.	1
12200	Can't able to log in with my work permit fin number and name is showing wrong always why like this can reply me please	1
12201	Weird hole in the App... There is no option on my device (S20 5G) to allow access to location information at all times. Even though the app primarily uses Bluetooth for positioning, what if the app is closed? I advise keeping the app running in the background just in case and adding it to your app whitelist if you have automatic-app-closing activated on your device.	1

We have to go to settings -apps -ehteraz -storage and click on clear data and clear cache.

12312	I am try to register but there is error	1
12313	It will not let me register my number. Just has a pop up that says invalid number. Please fix as it seems from other reviews I'm not the only one with this issue. I'm an android user... not sure if that helps.	1
12314	Cannot register as it cannot confirm my mobile number. Want to do the right thing :-(	1
12315	Unable to registering even otp recieved	1
12316	GOOD	0
12317	Useful tool but battery utilisation is too high. Need to optimise battery usage.	0
12318	What sort of data will this app share it with government and why does this app will share my data that should be my wish and you have not kept the option of don't agree it's just showing I Agree.	1
12319	You can use this app for going out I love going out	0
12320	The app is really good and one thing also the app has automatically log out	0
12321	Great idea but it would be much better if it gave you a push notification about how your feeling rather than having to remember to open the app and say felling well. People will forget all about the app and not open it everyday to etc etc.	0
12322	No source code available, do not trust it. Open source software ensures the validity and security of the app by allowing independent review, inspection and oversight, and is further more recommended by the eHealth community and WHO. If the app is vulnerable, showing the source code does not change that vulnerability, nor does it stop anyone for exploiting it, rather it stops all the open source developers from finding and solving the issue.	1
12323	It's an important app. But is only useful if your phone doesn't run out of battery. I normally finish the day on 65%. I've had to plug by phone in to charge during the day. I'm now at 12% after a 25% top up charge. This thing eats batteries for breakfast. Uninstalling.	0
12324	Easy to install. Works ok. For an app financed by belgian authorities I would have expected a multilingual (Fr, Nl, G) interface... This will increase adoption rate !	0

12338	It's real and gives clear updates	0
12339	Frustrating, keeps telling me that the phone number is invalid. Have entered several times, with and without the zero.	1
12340	I give this app five star, because it helping of our health improve.but when I am not in a public places, I should have free choice to turn off my Bluetooth or location because this app designed for public places. so some people have an issue with their phone battery life I hope see those option for the next update free choice.	0
12341	This app drains the battery very quickly due to the need for Bluetooth and location services to be turned on constantly. I just want to use the QR scanner function without the need for Bluetooth and location services.	1
12342	Amazing app, you can track and monitor your health with this app assistance for your health, and a contract tracing feature a simple ways to know whats on your area big thumbs up for this great app easy to use, ??????highly recommended StaySafe everyone	0

12350	I keyed in my mobile number but app said not a valid S'pore number. It's provided free by TPG	1
12351	Frustrating to set up. The app will not accept your phone number, saying there is an error with your phone number, if there is a problem on the previous screen. Where you enter your name, the supplied model shows "First, Family" name implying to put a comma between your names, but doing so gives the message on the subsequent page about the phone number. In addition where you enter your number, the prefix +61 is written for you. But you must enter the initial zero, despite international protocols	1

12359	It's not letting me login...?	1
12360	This app is redundant and it's only purpose is to help drain your battery faster, now electrical bills very expensive you know? So troublesome for what hastily release a flawed app and force everyone to install, don't even get me started on security risks. Might as well just give all of us a tracking device.. oh wait.	1

12387	I am not able to install the app!!!!	1
12388	This app has caused unusual behavior to my Oppo Reno 12. The Notification sound activated very frequently and the icons shown top of my phone blinks even after Bluetooth was turned off.

12397	Deleted. Huge waste of Aus taxpayer $. Built on lies, corruption & nepotism so offensive to most Australian values/expectations of govt it'd make Machiavelli blush! It's now clear why (despite myriad proven benefits) they so vehemently oppose open source - they've always known it didn't work on locked iPhones + a major dev/support contract went to Delv Pty Ltd (a company with ties to the. Liberal party). Then MP Robert blamed the program's failure on Apple/Google. Criminals.	1

I had to deinstall it to solve the problem	0

12421	Tested negative and my Ehteraz status was stuck at Yellow (Quarantined) for several days even after the quarantine period. I was not able to go to work because the security barred me from entering. I even showed my sms message confirming I was negative and showed the HMC certificate showing the quarantine period yet it was disregarded because they only follow the Ehteraz status. I called the Ehteraz hotline and daily you kept saying it will be updated "tomorrow". Your tomorrow lasted for a week	1

12430	This app: 1. Destroys your phone's battery life. 2. Interferes with bluetooth connections to you car. Since installing this app my car bluetooth connection keeps dropping out and requires constant reconnection. This is dangerous in an emergency. 3. It does not actually work as advertised yet. No contact tracing has happened through the app. What data is this app actually collecting and where is it going?	1

12440	Not working	1
12441	App crashes won't even open or give error message	1
12442	There is something wrong with my app. Even when I have switched on Bluetooth and location, the app does not detect any contact.	1
12443	Guys if you are getting the message of wrong credentials while registering, go to GDRFA Amer services (don't go anywhere else), and get the mobile number linked to your Emirates ID updated.

Your welcome all those who are resisting. Thank you to everyone who is participating. Thank you to Govt for the app and doing the best they can to keep us with low sickness and away from the devastating loss of lives like overseas.

12468	Works perfectly fine for me and doesn't interfere with Bluetooth. Sidenote: Registration on the app was not in operation for the first hours of the app being released, hence many of the negative reviews.	0
12469	Deleted as now requires location to be on. Used to work with Bluetooth only, but can't have location on constantly. Will download again if they fix	1
12470	Was not aware the app store all bluetooth contacts (which can reach up to 20m away). I thought it only stores contacts within 1.5m for 15 minutes. This was deliberately poor communication on the federal government's behalf and a massive breach of privacy.	1
12471	Useless app	1
12472	If this operated properly then we wouldn't have to spend time using a QR code to login to places we're attending. Nobody has proved to me that this is a good contract tracker or tracer!	1

It would also be nice to link all paper permits to the app. Some of the dependents do not life with the household and the app should take that into consideration. It should also take into consideration laborers living with the household but are not on his kafalah such as maids on contract through labour service offices.	0

12499	If there is a chance the app can save lives it's worth the bugs. Yes it compromises other Bluetooth connections and battery usage slightly increases, but both are preferable to death.

12510	Again an app designed by morons. If you use bt, why need all the personal data? PDPA says only ask for the personal data you need for the task at hand. Is the government not bound to its own laws? Seems like. And then you have to keep bt on and running this monster in background - but you still have to scan into each and every location you enter??? You guys actually understand WHY you added the bt feature??? Seems not. Embarrasing.	1

12571	**** updated review **** EVERYTIME THERE IS AN UPDATE FOR THIS RETARDED APP YOU HAVE TO TOTALLY RE REGISTER ALL YOUR DETAILS Total utter c@#p Face scanner don't work. So it give you option of doing video to confirm your passport photo. 6 times it fails. Says I sent photo not video even though its video Says its too long, even when I managed to make the video last only 1 second. Well good look tracking me now on NHS app As I'm now changing all email and phone number. This app is clearly a SCAM	1
12572	It is a simple to use app that I’m sure will be greatly improved in the following weeks!	0
12573	Informative	0
12574	Just tried to sign up now and the app is live, telling me, my number is invalid and I've had this number for years	1
12575	Very good tracing app	0
12576	The App is very helpful and informative. Keep up the good work.	0
12577	Helpful apps	0
12578	The worst app ever it doesn't work	1
12579	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
12580	nice it	0
12581	Good to be the first in the world to have this concept of tracing however I'm seriously very tempted to uninstall it as its disrupting my bluetooth connection as we teleconf much more now.	0
12582	nice	0
12583	It's not working	1
12584	You need to enable the location or the app does not work! This means that you can't use the app and prevent other apps or Google to track your precise locations. It may be true that the app does not use the locations, but the only way to have it working is allowing all the other apps and Google to track your locations. This is a grave loophole. I normally don't want apps to track me all the time, so I can't use this app. Please,inform user correctly!	1
12585	After a painful sign up the app just hung on me.	1
12586	I found the app overall to be very good. It runs with no issues and it is nice to see updates on figures etc. The reason I am deducting 1 Star is that twice I've had to uninstall the app as it was causing my phone to overheat.	0
12587	Terrible app. When left on, the app interferes with my bluetooth connection to audio devices. I can't drive with my phone connected to my car as the audio just skips everytime. Same thing with bluetooth connection to me earphones when I run. At this rate, I would rather petition the government not to use this app or even issue the token since it interferes with my life more than necessary.	1
12588	After I updated the app it stopped working. I reinstalled it and cleared cashe but still isn't working. 109 are not answering the phone. This has been my situation for a week now. This is not acceptable service for a mandatory app!!	1

12594	map is not working properly... Good effort over all..	0
12595	Decided to pull the app off my devices. A10 battery stats - app has high battery drain while running in background. I'm not a tech guy, but I'm eliminating apps that suck juice.. On stock Android 9, I had problem. So i decided to use custom ROM on A10 (just before the devs replied, so I couldn't follow up since different OS). When paused, can't even back out of the app which means it's actually in foreground. Play Store says app may not be optimised for my device. I go get token. Stay safe!	1
12596	Keep shutting down	1

12604	When loaded this apps on my mobile phone, my phone can't connect to my car and home audio bluetooth. After removing it, everything back to normal. Phone model Samsung Note 9	1
12605	Destroys Bluetooth connectivity. The 'Your Phone' app on windows 10 no longer connects. Constantly nags me to connect to my PC. Android 9 on Samsung galaxy S8+	1
12606	What the heck...it's really useless... Because of this app we can't enter any place.....first of all its not showing the health status???	1
12607	Was working perfectly, however in the past 24 hours it is draining my battery very quickly. 100% to 10% in 5 hours. Looking at battery stats it's the Covid app combined with Google Play Services is causing problems. Had to uninstall until fixed so please get it sorted.	1
12608	They ask for storage permission!!..i dont know what does this has to do with the app	1
12609	Excellent	0
12610	After updated.. It kept reconnecting my bluetooth..	1
12611	No option to turn off app. (For times when i am at home) Needs better integration (Still need to do safe entry although this app can track me ) Drains battery too fast.With so many issues it is hard to have huge usage for such an important app *Update* App improves with safe entry scanning, ability to pause	1

12636	Quick and easy	0
12637	Very nice app	0
12638	Works fine. Excellent design re security, private data etc. It doesn't ask special permissions, and it doesnt send anything to the Govt unless you are exposed to or have the virus and they ask you to press a button on the app to send them the phone numbers of people near you for a while, and no location data. This is pretty well designed and appears safe...no real security/privacy data issues to be concerned about.	0
12639	Great app, wish they could do something similar for STIs	0
12640	nice	0
12641	Battery drain appears to be an issue in first release. Hopefully should be addressed immediately in order encourage/attract more users.	1
12642	good	0
12643	I tried to sign up for the app, however it did not work. First, I was asked to validate my name, then I was asked to validate my NRIC. So I don't know what else I can do from there.	1
12644	Since installing. Can't play music through car.	1
12645	How to get more downloads on your app? 1) say its optional but highly recommended 2) force your conscripts into downloading it 3) ??? 4) PROFIT! What you gonna do? CHARGE ME LORH! But srsly, yes the pandemic is a serious problem. You guys can say you have state of the art security measures in place to prevent security breaches. But what you gonna do when it does get out? The most you can say is 'too bad we'll do better'. Is it a problem if ppl don't want to download it due to privacy concerns?	1
12646	Downloaded this app when it was available. I live in BC and so far there is no reporting in my area with no indication when I can expect it to be functional. BLUF this app is useless for people who live outside of Ontario and Quebec. The development of this app had the right idea and intent but the GoC failed to meet its objective to give all Canadians a tool to help combat COVID 19. I will continue to physical distance, frequent hand washing and kindness to everyone as they so far have proved the most effective methods to date. I have no confidence that this app will protect Canadians.\n\nThis is an app was released almost 2 months ago and still no reporting in my province (British Columbia). Still disappointed that we can’t utilize this GoC initiative in my home province. I understand the delay in getting all provinces on board but 2 months is ridiculous.	1
12647	I like it	0
12648	I downloaded the app because I want to help. However, it’s been draining my battery like crazy. The stats from the battery app testify to this fact. You need to fix this ASAP otherwise I’ll have to uninstall, which I don’t want to, as I think this app is key in fighting COVID-19.	1
12649	Very poor programming. Requires your gps location before the app is fully running. Ah hell no. Ur not getting my gps data.	1

12653	A problem occurred.	1
12654	Need more local update	1
12655	The application cannot be open because it keep on crashing. I called 109, advice to just wait for an hour or try in the morning to register because the system had a technical problem. If it's not working uninstall the apps and reinstall again the apps and try to register. I tried many times But still not working. Found out that their latest update v8.0.0 is not compatible with Android 10. So how I can install the previous app that works for Android 10.	1
12656	Easy to install and setup. I wish it were available for other countries to use. Why hasn't the WHO made this their own priority, rolling out global mobile device app based contact tracing?	0
12657	Although i really would like to keep this app for obvious reasons. Unfortunately it has caused my phone to lag and not preform as it had been prior to the installation of this app. If these issues are fixed? I would gladly download again.	1
12658	Nice application	0
12659	Finally downloaded it with the return to level 2. It actually does work well and does what it’s meant to. Significantly quicker than handwriting your details everywhere I find. Plus you avoid those ‘dirty’ pens. And majority of businesses seem to be on board with providing QR code’s at the entrance, exit and throughout the interior. Highly recommend	0

12674	Destroys battery life. Ever since Kildare, Offaly and Laois went back into lockdown, the app constantly runs in the background. It caused my brand new Samsung S20 to go from 100% to 0% in 4 hours. I would usually only charge the phone once every 2 days.	1

If anyone looks sick it's best to point your phone at them with the app on. This will sterilise them to give you enough time to escape without getting COVID	1

12829	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
12830	Good job, guys!\n\n- Would be great to be able to add places you have been to manually without QR code, given not all places will participate or it might be unpractical in places.\n- Would be great to communicate where the data goes and where not more clearly.	0
12831	This app is useless, it has been reported multiple times as being useless. For Covid app to be of any use they need to use the technology that was developed by Google and Apple. The only thing this app does is drain your battery.	1
12832	Why can't this app just run smoothly without everytime asking me to allow it to switch my Bluetooth on when it is already on? Instead of using Bluetooth why don't you make it use data instead?	1
12833	Good	0
12834	Says phone number invalid. It is my business owned phone and I tried both my name and business name but both said invalid phone number. Typical of Govt poor record on rollouts.	1
12835	I am using a Samsung Note8. Battery power is not impacted, neither are issues found on my active Bluetooth devices with the COVIDSafe now installed. If notifications bother you, simply block the notifications from this app.	0
12836	Good	0
12837	It says "there is something wrong with the connection" yet i have stable internet connection. I even opened my gps and bluetooth.	1
12838	This app is not working on my cell phone .	1

12840	Much better than previous version. Something I miss: having trend curves for each data. For example having the ICU occupancy %age is good, but having history trend curve would be much more helpful. It would allow to see if it goes up or down and at which rate.	0
12841	My account many time show your app is not working... what is the problem...	1

12845	Forced to download for work	1
12846	Thumbs up for the idea! Hope it works just as well. Update: I wish it were possible to change a Google account to have location history of the phone to sync with the app. It only asked me once and there is no setting to change...	0

12848	Rubbish app, when bluetooth keep on for this app it caused paywave on bus/mrt cant detected when screen is off!!!	1
12849	Thank you	0
12850	Hi there. I understand that the app need to be running in the background. However, I feel that the app is draining excessive power from my phone. Please take a look at this issue and fix it soon but good work on trying to curb the spread using the app.	1
12851	Privacy statement tells you that it does not use your location. Once app installed asks for location services to be turned on with a BS statement about android apps needing location services tp utilise bluetooth. My bluetooth is always on and never with location services turned on. Location sevices being on all the time would also unnecessarily use loads of battery power being on all the time as is required by this app. Immediately uninstalled.	1
12852	No tracing in republic! Only one app allowed to inform you of possible contact! Why does this not mesh with the republics app as we cross the border all the time.?	1
12853	This app drains the battery very quickly due to the need for Bluetooth and location services to be turned on constantly. I just want to use the QR scanner function without the need for Bluetooth and location services.	1
12854	How do you enable Huawei devices without Google Mobile Services to be able to use this app? For example, Mate 30 series, P40 series, etc?	1

12863	Server is not responding	1
12864	Simple to register. The more people who register, the quicker we can enjoy some life again. This has been used in Singapore successfully.	0
12865	This app has serious Bluetooth connection issue. It interferes other Bluetooth devices and make them not working properly, such as to ear phones. It's very annoying and so inconvenient. I must kill this app in order my other Bluetooth devices can work properly. Already many complaints about this. Fix this. No need to reply back this review by asking email to your support, OS version, screen captures and such things. Please take seriously before forcing people to use this.	1
12866	The app launches slowly (takes more than 5 seconds) and uses a lot of background RAM (>1GB) and slows down my phone a lot. While running in the background, it keeps crashing. If you're going to mandate the use of TraceTogether, pls make this app more usable.	1
12867	Registration error - the app doesn't recognise my number.	1
12868	Had to delete the app due to all the battery issues others have mentioned. My phone has basically become unusable with how quick the battery drains. This used to not happen at all so whatever change was made to cause this issue needs to be fixed. Would happily download it again if the issues is sorted.	1
12869	Very good aps	0
12870	not getting any response or help from this app	1
12871	Like many others had to uninstall app as over last 2 or so days the drain on battery was excessive, from 100 - 30% in 2 hours. No issue up until that and though app was great. Will install again once issue resolved.	1
12872	Bad	1
12873	Downloaded the app today, registered my email but the verification code kept being denied. Tried 4 times with new codes and still wouldn’t work. Now won’t let me register again as days “email already exists”, but still won’t let me log in. Tried deleting and reinstalling the app, still won’t work. What a waste of time when I’m trying to do the right thing!	1
12874	Draining my battery massively and causing my phone to overheat. Going to have to uninstall until it gets fixed.	1

12877	Staysafe App is really an awesome contact tracing app! My utmost admiration to the developers for its remarkable and very accurate contact tracing features. It keeps me from paranoia because of its capabilities. It makes me feel safe. No doubt why this was chosen by the Philippine Government to be the official Contact Tracing App. I hightly recommend this app to every Filipino Citizen to be used daily. Download, register and Stay Safe!	0
12878	Good magneficent app	0
12879	It keeps shutting down automatically within 5mins. Phone model is vivo.	1
12880	Finally gave in an downloaded this. Had to copy my code to add and all downhill since then. Can’t access any alpha or numerical keyboard to enter info. Two weeks to respond to this problem is failure in my books even though some update seem to fix the issue and I was able to add visits manually within 24hrs if loading it. So mixed feelings on benefits	1
12881	Good app \ud83d\udc4d by Govt	0
12882	Trash	1
12883	With the massive battery hog, this isn't even good for contact tracing. You can't really use it once your phone is flat because of having this running now can you. And I'm sure some people around me don't appreciate suddenly hearing my music out loud because of the bluetooth connection dropping.	1
12884	Bluetooth problem in the app, can't able to pair to other devices... everytime need to restart the mobile... plz update ASAP.	1

12891	Nice app	0
12892	i wld actually give a 5 stars if this app didn't ruin my day today. i was forced to download this app just to get into the cinema. but when i tried putting in my particulars, "temporarily unavailable" rlly? pls lah, dont force others to use if the app is not 100% useful leh. just bc of the "temporarily unavailable" i cldnt watch my damned movie and had to ask for a refund. is this how the gov works? give their citizens more trouble?	1
12893	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
12894	Good	0
12895	Good initiative but it's sometime asking disable Bluetooth,sometime asking enable Bluetooth.And it's draining the battery too much.I don't think that the app need access my storage.Is it requires for monitoring Covid-19? Can't log in last 2 days.	0

12914	Instead of criticizing each little or great effort authorities make to keep folks safe, be proactive, use the app and do your bit for Covid 19	1
12915	Seems ok, easy to set up and use, on android 9. Can easily turn off bluetooth at home etc if want to save some battery, turn on when go out. However the within 1.5m and for 15 min to record any interactions for 21 days ? Why 15 mins ? Is that a tradeoff ? Could it be say 5 mins or less ? Less time the more chance of app being effective I would of thought. Have not seen anything saying 15 mins is a level that will capture almost all interactions worth capturing or have I missed something ?	1
12916	There was a previous complaint which was fixed very efficiently. Good response timing. Updated the rating.	0
12917	I think it will be helpful for us.	0
12918	The app interferes with the bluetooth connection of Samsung phones. After installing the app on my and my family members Samsung phones, it causes our bluetooth devices to drop the connection with the phones. Now we cannot connect with our devices. Please fix this. Thanks	1

12956	I had to uninstall. This app was draining my mobile's battery in less than 8 hours. Also the data provided is not useful in telling how the app is helping us to prevent new cases. i. e. . How many people has been advised to isolate because close contact was detected. Irish Tax money was used for this app. I am disappointed.	1

13023	I have a Huawei p40 Pro. After installing the app l get a notification that l must upgrade. If you try a message states upgrade no longer available. At that point you cannot log in. Thus everything stops hence total failure. Further to your reply please note l downloaded the app in full. Upon entering the app the message l noted appeared. The message stated to add an upgrade. When l tried to upgrade a further message stated... No upgrade available. At that point the app stalls l have 256gb internal plus additional 128gb of memory. So more than enough. The issue is this so called upgrade which is in addition to the NHS app and the fact the upgrade has supposedly expired and is no longer available.	1

I would love to reset my page to green, to be notified again if I am exposed to another source, but the app doesn’t allow me to do it...

13115	Honestly I fear this App doesn't work on certain Phones. I've went day without a check, but my wife who has the same App on a different phone and is constantly by my side has had several checks. I'm beginning to wonder if it's the Phone you have the App download on which receives more that other checks	1
13116	Very helpful application I like it	0
13117	The app was easy enough to install and doesn't seem to have an adverse effect on battery life. However i cannot connect to my car media center for hands free, maps etc. Once i removed the app , i could once again connect my phone to my car.	1
13118	I think this app helpful	0
13119	Useless app. Keeps telling me my phone number is invalid. Numerous tries. Makes no difference. If it cannot accept a simple phone number I have no interest in why. I expect an easy error free process and have no interest spending any time to fix any of problem this abysmal app needs. Piece of junk.	1

13125	I like it. Simple design & no privacy infringement. Plus English is really good! Needs a lot more downloads to be effective though. It's up to us!	0
13126	The App is clear, lean and very simple to use. Only the battery consumption should be optimised.	0
13127	The app doesn't appear to work on Android, everyone I know that has an iPhone gets a weekly notification and Android phones don't. When I go to the app setting and check the battery usage it's always 0 so doesn't appear to be running	1
13128	Setelah diupdate, "sesi" sering berakhir dan selalu kembali ke halaman konfirmasi nomor hp	1

13136	Cool! Thanks.	0
13137	I'm giving this app 1 star, I'd give minus if possible. For MONTHS, I cannot even get the OTP. Kept prompting 'check your Internet connection and try again, there seems to be a network issue'. I am so pathetic I have no WiFi at home, no phone data. That's what you telling me right? Now you telling us this app or your token is the only way do a safe entry check in/out? This app SUCKS now you want us to carry another token around. Hey thank you for the idea but make sure it works.	1

13169	I got a notification to check in, but when i open the app, I don’t get an option to capture selfie.	1
13170	Unfortunately this thing drains my battery harder than any other 'passive' app out there. I can run for 16 odd hours with my usual usage on a Pixel 4 XL. With this installed (and no other new apps added) that cut down under half. Also the perpetual notification icon is incredibly annoying - it's called a notification bar for a reason, to notify, not to clog up with useless icons.	1
13171	Had to uninstall - the last few days it's eating my battery and phone is unusable	1
13172	Very good	0
13173	I have Android 10 and unable to set it up. I could download the app, but it crashes and doesn't allow to set up my profile When will the upgrade come for Android 10 Developer-Kindly provide solution asap	1
13174	Easy peasy way for C-19 to stay away!	1
13175	Terrible app besides draining battery 3 times the rate, it interferes with fitness app synckng with your fitness tracker. Rendering all your fitness tracking app useless. To assist tracing you have to give up the base functions of what you use your phone for.	1
13176	Yh it's a good idea if you're 6 years old assuming that everyone is going to download it... A small childish idea where we all live in a utopia downloading this app at the same time... This only works if the government forces you to download it by law... Only downloaded because I thought there was going to be a surprising new idea to uncover... Yh turns out it's like Pokémon GO without any Pokémon	1

13187	The idea of such an app is very good, however, the technicalities are poor. The app is draining my phone battery and doesn't work without a permission to obtain access to the gallery and calls, which I am not fine with. Moreover, after installing it, I simply cannot control bluetooth on my phone, even if I switch it off, it lights up the screen and switches the bluetooth on itself (!). Not to mention that each notification is renounced many times and whenever comes also lights up the screen.	0
13188	The app drains a huge amount of battery in a short amount of time. It also causes my wifi speed to decrease and reduces my productivity. Please make the app more battery efficient.	1

Please make this available when you are bringing babies to the polyclinic yet you need physical ID to scan in. This is increasing touch point which is defeats the original idea of reducing touch point	1

13219	From last 10 to 14 days app has stopped sensing users which comes in bluetooth proximity, as it's now not showing data to be updated to server and number of proximity count is decreasing day to day. while working in busy work environment and aftera reinstalling app,status is still same, app is not able to discover other aarogya setu app users through bluetooth proximity. Also same status with other aarogya setu app being used in other phone. So please check.	1

13229	I cannot log nor I can put date of birth, its not working for me, not at all good app.	1
13230	Very simple user interface, and a great tool for the Nation to continue to fight this virus. Everybody should do their bit and use it. Excellent approach, no centralised database, and using only bluetooth anonymously to track interactions. The data protection statements are in simple plain English, and with the source code publicly available it's an example of best practice in transparency. Ireland is one of the World leaders in Covid-19 response, and this is another tool in our toolkit.	0

13248	I like the reporting and symptom tracking but the app crashes so hard every time I use it that it freezes my entire phone. This is not good and should not even be possible. Please find and fox the source of this performance and stability issue. It's a major nuisance as it adds two minutes to my daily check-in and often encourages me not to bother tracking my temp or symptoms at all.	1
13249	Waste app	1
13250	I cant update?	1
13251	Easy to install, hopefully we never need it. However feeling safer already. Now we need everyone to install it!!!	0
13252	1 star because I'm forced to download this but for some reason still required to use safeentry and fill up declaration forms. If this doesn't reduce the forms or SafeEntry I have to fill, I don't see the point of the app. Why is DOB and IC issue date required for tracing? Is there a need to check for spoofing? Have people been registering with other IC? I see I see. So you're saying that SafeEntry is ineffective then?	1

13255	it drains my battery like hell since it always runs in the background, requires bluetooth to be switched on 24/7, and most important DOESNT EVEN WORK unless everyone else is as stupid as you to use this faulty app. GovTech please stop promoting trash to us	1

13273	Hi. This trace together app can not assessible in Huawei mobile phones. I have bought and then only I have noticed that this application is incompatible to that phone. I have checked with the shopper. But they directed me towards customer service. But still not received any news.. kindly advice me that where can I go and complaint on this issue. Or any other ongoing processes to resolve the issue. Otherwise the government have to cease all the Huawei phones sales which is not assess the GOV.sg application untill resolve this issue.which can help the people those unknowingly purchase these phones	1

Had verified using the same TraceTogether account with another phone and it still works well. Please kindly see if it is this new MIUI was not accounted for, thanks!	1
13293	Will not download onto my 1year old state of the art smatphone. Bad, as a user of many android apps what are you thinking. I have found more than 3700 other users that can not use this app. Come on you must no you have problem.	1
13294	I'm more than happy to use the app. But it keeps closing itself. I realise who knows how long later and have to reopen it. I wonder how many trips to the supermarket were missed because the app closed?	0
13295	Awful the pin number is only on for about 3 seconds	1
13296	I have tried 3 times to log in. Every time I try to see the code they sent, I lose the page and have to start again. Unless I can see the code without losing the page, I can't sign up. Now that I have downloaded it, it constantly turns off the battery permissions.	1
13297	Like the others, extreme battery draining and overheating the phone, had to uninstall which is against the purpose of this app... Will check again in a few weeks if the issue is fixed	1
13298	Icons and some parts are still in english when i selected chinese language option. Hope u will fix this soon so i can setup for chinese speaking relatives. Thanks.	1
13299	Will never again download this app,kills your phone and drains battery	1
13300	This uses the privacy preserving contact tracing methods developed jointly by Apple and Google. Your past contacts are anonymously stored on the phone and you are alerted if a contact (who runs the app as well) is tested positive. The effectiveness would increase of more people used this. So keep using it folks! This is not created solely to inform people about latest numbers, nor "hotspot locations", so negative comments are a bit missing the mark.	1
13301	I was all for this app but after learning our data will be stored in a foreign owned public cloud service hosted in a Chinese owned data centre. What was the department of home Affairs thinking	1

What's the point of the code if the result are not registered... Should have been faster by the app then a letter to my doc and me calling him. If labs don't use it, why should I bother with it and let it drain my battery? Aren't the hospital supposed to be "high risk"? 'Cause I stayed there for a full 2h and I still I'm green/low risk...	1

13331	Very easy to set up - asks for minimal information, just first name and number. Only problem is I nearly uploaded my information at the bottom where it asks \u2018has a health professional asked you to upload your information?\u2019 I think that\u2019s just for confirmed cases???!  Not worried at all about scaremongering of the government having my info - I have a Medicare card, bank accounts, a passport, licence etc - pretty sure I have enough for them to track me if they could be bothered! and if privacy is really a concern to you - why are you people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, PayPal, eBay, etc etc etc.... they have more than enough on you if they want!   Do it - look after each other Australia - let\u2019s not be like Europe or the USA and lose so many lives.	0

13380	I like the simplicity of the app. Everything is very useful. However it's been draining my battery like a hungry hippo. Just today it already contributed to 34% of the battery usage. Yesterday night I went to sleep with 100% battery. I woke up and the phone was turned off with 0% battery left. I'm using a Samsung Note10+. I check the diagnostics and this app seems to be causing the trouble. So I'm currently 80% sure that I will uninstall this app soon.	1

13405	Battery drain on Motorola phone. I also have the battery drain problem so removed the app. I read in the paper that Google rolled an update but nowhere does it state how you can tell if you have received this update. Looking at the system updates tells me device is up-to-date but that the last security patch was the 1/1/2019.	1
13406	Very clean and simple app!	0

13416	Started causing a lot of battery drain this weekend and had to un install it. It demands to have bluetooth and location on all the time but that's pointless if you're stuck in the house.	1
13417	App does not state the time or location of when you were exposed to someone with covid. This makes it difficult to know which people should be notified of your exposure and which people could not have been affected by your exposure, which renders the app almost useless.	1

13449	1. There was like 1-2 seconds delayed during checking in/out comparing to SingPass SafeEntry check in(it is almost instant).\n\n2. Should have one group check in button to press instead of every time I have to press check in then press back again only can choose group check in. (Widget)\n\n3. Should have option to search for location as well. If you would like to says not to has location search is to ensure everyone appear on where they are then you should not have the  favourite.\n\nPlease refer to SingPass safe entry to adopt their functionality, they did a great app and widget.	1

13451	Good very helpful	0
13452	I've had the app on my Oppo for quite a while now. No matter how many times I set the permissions to disable battery optimisation, it never, ever sticks. Every time I look at my phone, it says I've chosen for that app in particular to use up as much juice as it likes. But the app says it's not active and I need to check my permissions again. The last advice I found online, was to uninstall the app, update my OS and reinstall. But when I did that I found I already have the latest update!	1
13453	I've been trying to complete my profile but unable to. It keeps on asking to check in the fields as the validation fails. Reinstalling but still the same result. I will have to uninstall for now as it now useless in my phone storage.	1
13454	Didn't detect my daughter as a close contact to an infected student, even though she had the app. The school alerted us to that fact. Pointless app if it fails to detect close contacts. Id give it 0 if I could.	1
13455	This app will not help stop the spread. Its only a tools for tracking people who were in nearby or contact with the one that is infected. The only way to protect individual is to behave what a doctor in the hospital did. Wear mask and keep your hand sanitizer before and after. Eg before boarding train, entering supermarket. & sanitize after coming out of the places. If everybody does it it will be a double protection. Imagine the contact tracing people also down with the virus, whats the point?	1

13459	Can't get the OTP... How to install! The developer state the Huawei Mate 30 cause it. But my bank app have been in mate 30 using OTP got not problem. So... If you want this app as only one app. It is no a good app, key reason is Bluetooth is on even you kill off the app when you are at home. It don't make sense at all to on bluetooth when you are at home!. I will go for the QR scanner better. Plus check out the covid active area will do.	1

13478	Simple and intuitive to setup for speakers of any language: click 2 boxes in agreement, and respond to request in user's language for activating notifications by "turning on", and you're covered for Covid-19 contact tracing, indicated by check mark in app's main page.

13494	Beware. Disgustingly bad battery hog.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIn response to my prior comment Health Canada says ...”the app is designed to\nminimize battery ... usage”.  Really? Seriously?  That’s a flat out lie: If it had been optimized it would have geofenced to stop pinging when at home and it definitely doesn’t, per usage below.  \n\nSingle largest complaint from users is battery drain. Don’t tell me it’s optimized when it patently is not.\n\nUPDATE 2\n\nApp uninstalled from wife’s iPhone SE due to excessive battery drain. \n\n———\n\nIn two days on an iPhone X, 96% of the 32% drop in battery charge was due to this app. It left home for an hour and neither it nor I met anyone. \n\nWorse still was my wife’s brand new iPhone SE: a 26% drop in battery charge was 99% due to the COVID Alert app in 23hrs.  Usually 6-8% drop per day with similar use: the phone hadn’t left her dresser. \n\nGood thing the dog doesn’t have a phone.\n\nClearly some work needed.	1
13495	I believe it would be better if app gives approximate(offcourse actual location cannot be given due to data privacy issues) location or area of covid positive cases so that other people can avoid visits to those areas. The current numbers don't give a picture from where the new cases are coming, even a county wise daily detail would help.	0
13496	Fake application no show results	1
13497	Aarogya Setu Team, I have written an email about my concern on your email ID but no one has responded for more than 24 hours. Labs are informing positive patients details to ICMR and then ICMR sending it to Aarogya setu app team. However if releasing report of negative then they are not sending it to ICMR. Ultimately person from positive to negative will always shows positive. And support will not respond to emails.	1
13498	I appreciate this app a lot especially it clarifies the privacy portion.\n\nHowever, the app drained my iphone x (ios 13.6 and ios 13.6.1) battery by 40% when I was asleep and no other app was running in the background (even in low power mode). I hope the developer can fix it.	0

13525	Why App required to manage our call details and access to Photo and Gallery? This option should be removed. Feature to be added to turn ON App only when going out or any visitor coming at home. It will protect battery to get drain.	1

13536	Battery drain, unable to use or to update. I social distance all the time. Have mixed view on app, good idea to quell fear in anxious or medically challenged individuals, but not everyone in society has access to this kind of technology, so other methods of semi controlling this virus are more effective. As, regards privacy, I have many concerns, with data harvesting. No, app is a 100pc safe, but, I truly suspect that many will, not use this, due to an invasion of Civil Liberties and non clarity	1

We scanned in, when we arrived at our destination, we are checking out from the station we check in. Surely, for MRT station, you should have a QR code for checking out. Especially, if we are transferring from one line to another line. The link is lost, and we end up losing track of whether we checked out. Most ppl ignore the QR code check in/out.	1

13581	Still not loading. Keeps stalling at the phone number. Is it on Android system only? No use counting downloads if it won't work.	1
13582	The app is good and easy to use jnnut get rid of the permanent notification! It's so annoying always being there and the only way to get rid of it is to turn off notifications, but that ruins the point of the app. With notifications off I can't get notifications if I have been near someone with Covid-19, but I hate the notification! 5 stars if they get rid of it.	0

13584	i switch to new mobile and it does not allow me to reg my same number on the app of the new phone, even after uninstalling the app on the old phone. no OTP receive.	1

13591	Dumped the useless piece of junk.	1
13592	Third class	1
13593	It drains out my mobile phone battery faster than usual.	1
13594	Pros: Nice UI Cons: Drains battery. It needs to your get mobile number to sign up. Takes too much personal information for generating QR Code. Establishments in the ph don't require people to scan QR Codes or don't have QR Codes you can scan in the first place. Does nothing offline. You can't delete your account. People should leave honest reviews here.	1
13595	Why its asking for permission for storage	1
13596	I keep getting message that it will be installed on my device soon I do not understand. Is it my device is the problem	1
13597	Perfect	0
13598	Great. No complaints.	0
13599	I support the project. But in my case it consumes a lot of battery and my phone do not reach the evening any more. That is also the moment of the day where I potentially meet more peoples. So it makes the application unuseful to me. Maybe an idea would be to have the possibility to define some criteria where the application stop itself. For example by checking for available wireless? I think the application don't need to run at home or at work (if it is not related with public). That would maybe save a lot of battery.	1

13605	Updated just recently but after few days BUGS still kept happening. Please fix your app we're compromising our status especially there are checkpoints. I just bought a new phone for this! Update: 14/7 - This past few days, every now and then the app shows "QUESTION MARK" again, it's really annoying every time you go inside a establishment that ask you to show your Etheraz then it will just show a question mark. It's either you will open through the playstore or u need to uninstall/install it.	1
13606	Good	0
13607	Terrible terrible terrible app. I've spent two days trying to register and still cannot. sms OTP never reaches my foreign number, no option for email OTP, no way to ask for assistance and trouble shoot. Got local number just for this useless app, then it still fails every time, because it now says my data connection isn't working, when every other app works fine. Tried both WiFi and data, switched phone on and off, uninstalled and reinstalled. Same issue. Can't go anywhere in Singapore now. \ud83d\udca9	1

13616	3rd Edit:this app not only disturb the sound of bluetooth earpiece but disruptive to games n while watching movies maybe even other tasks or apps.. omg every min the movies will stagger for 3secs thus the sound goes intermittent. Tried uninstall the tracecrap n everything is back to normal. I wonder How much did the gov pay the app dev... for an app that "destroy" a person daily life =_=" seriously im waiting for the bloody token for my family... already got to bare the battery consumption.	1

13653	Very Good App, because of this app and Hard work of MoPH Department , Qatar could beat the Covid-19 Pandemic.	0
13654	App not optimised. Affect phone performance such as causing lag and causing breakage in bluetooth earphone music. Poorly developed.	1
13655	All the bad reviews didn\u2019t read the information that you couldn\u2019t register until after 6pm. If you waited there was no problem. Anyway good on them for trying to get in early	1
13656	Goal is great, execution lacking. Or maybe testing. Crashes my Bluetooth every few hours. 'I'm Alive' notification disappears quickly. Have battery optimisation off for this app. Get to work debugging... I need to reboot Android every few hours at this rate. And I need to get out of this lockdown.	0
13657	Recent update fix the crash issue I experienced. Still, is there any need of bluetooth connection? There's no explanation about it. I wish there's a map or something about the the red zone. The app show that I'm in a red zone, yet when I look at the list of red zone, it's not on the list(?)	1
13658	Please check the "cumulative" active case curve... The number of active cases may go down... But how can the cumulative value go down??	1

By the time I realised it disappered, it is too late as I am already on the bus or already back at home. Just a feedback for improvement.	1
13670	Burning my phone a few week ago hope its improved by now.	1
13671	When I try to complete my profile using my student's pass, it dosent work and tells me that they are temporarily unavailable and ti try again later, after I while even if I try again it says the same thing. But it worked perfectly fine for my friend. Is my device the cause or the app? I need some help.	1
13672	It's the 29th today, but Kildare is stuck on 27th.	1
13673	Unfortunately, I've had to uninstall this app because of the battery draining issue. I am ready and waiting to re-install it as soon as they fix this issue.	1
13674	Overall experience was good. But since last week its been draining my battery very heavily. My OnePlus which used to stay for almost 1.5 days, started draining out in a few hours. Uninstalled this app and now my phone is back to normal.	1

I had to delete the app again even though I want to use it.	1

13687	Hi I have Problem i ts not working with me	1
13688	Many phones are not compatible with this app! 3 out of 4 phones we tried to download this app are not compatible.....because they are too old! We have lost confidence in this app doing what's been promised to because not enough people will have it!	1
13689	Like the new interface after the update. How does this daily exchange users work? I stayed at home whole day, left my phone on the desk. Now I have 950+ users exchanged? Is this right?	1
13690	This app very comfortable	0
13691	Can we have the app scan the safe entry QR code instead of letting others scan me. Its redundant to have my nric barcode on app when I already have it in my wallet. Preferably I would like to have a very close range bluetooth or nfc where I can tap in & tap out using the app.	1
13692	I can't even open the app!!!	1
13693	Can not work on my Huawei P40 pro	1
13694	Facing problem, could not registered yet. Msg received " ID Card Expired" my ID is valid Untill month of Sep 2020.	0
13695	The pause function is good if we can customize/set the pause duration to save battery life while we at home. Please also work on making the app workable for Huawei phones without Google services.	1
13696	In this situation, this application is a Blessing for everyone to fight this pandemic and prevent the spread of the virus. To the thought of making this app I salute you.	0
13697	Constantly being killed in the background. I've told Android to leave it alone, don't know why my phone would be killing it given that I've got 8gb of ram and usually about 5gb free.	1
13698	It would be great to be able to see the daily figures of new cases and any deaths as well as overall totals. At the moment daily new case figures are just show in a chart with no figures.	1

13744	Update: now scanning with singpass requires this app but nothing happens ie cannot sign in. Doesnt take up much battery and no data usage required. Great job! Friend cant install on S10 though (mines note 10 and works fine).	1

13756	Why it needs to get storage access? If not granting storage access app not working.	1
13757	It's good for health	0
13758	Suggest to improvise the app to boost more related tracing features such as to be able to use it to scan SafeEntry QR code, lock the location then if the subject leaves that location, reminds him to check-out. And, to sound an alert when the subject goes to a location a confirmed case had visited with date and time.	1
13759	Unable to download	1
13760	One of the most stupid app from govt: every time app goes in background it logs me out so it doesn't capture any stats. Everytime I open app it asks for login.	1
13761	App failed to validate my details despite them being right. Not sure what’s the reason for invalidation too.	1
13762	Keep saying validation fail.	1
13763	Doesn't have an Exposure Notifications badge ? on the app so I can't turn on Exposure Notifications in Settings. Galaxy S10 - software all updated and even turned it off and on again.... Will re-rate when I can get it to work. UPDATE - "Clear the Cache in Google Play Services" and it will all allow exposure notifications if you're having the same issue I had.	1

This is meant to aid in the tracing efforts with minimum inconvenience to the user. Batt and BT, these are the most basic needs of most smart phone users. Please improve on this asap.	1

13834	I have no problem with this app being secure. But as long as the OS's they are running on are 'not' secure...sorry not using.\n\nHopefully being public about not using this will serve as pressure to cell companies that the simple fact that you 'can' invade anyones cell at any time is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\n\nMap all the legit towers and make that map constantly available to the public and updated. Force phones to use only them and alert user of any deviations and force Apple (at least) to remove network restrictions that prevent VPN's from functioning properly.\n\nThen I'll consider usng this.\n\nExample : iPhone 11 running iOS 13 : Turn off wifi and cell data, disable all system services and send an SMS or try using Signal to send a message...until these and other issues are addressed (inability to disable audio/cameras, etc) count me out. And Stingers, etc? PASS.	1

13847	As you probably know, many people hate the Rousky. And now there is an app with the same name. It is useful for sure, but I think naming it after something lots of people hate is kind of bad marketing. Anyway, I will give it a try.	0

13857	Great app until a couple of days ago. It's burning out the batteries all of a sudden. Where is the update to fix this bug? I heard on the news it was sorted but I don't see any update available. Please hurry	1
13858	Simple and a great idea	0

13860	I like the idea of this app but it kept crashing my phone. Would be better if you were able to turn it off when ot needed. Had to uninstall it because it prevented me from answering calls. Which defeats the purpose of having a phone.	0
13861	Great idea but I couldn't register. Error indicates that my phone number is invalid after several attempts! Finally managed to register.	0
13862	This app is not working. If you have a foreign phone number, app won't recognize and you won't able to get a hes code. Disappointing.	1
13863	Force close mulu	1
13864	Unable to even download the app. It says waiting for download.	1

13871	While this is a great initiative, it is causing issues on my S20+. Battery drain aside, whenever I'm on a call, it switches to speaker mode intermittently during a call. Therefore, I had to uninstall the app. Hopefully this gets resolved soon.	0
13872	When I put information as visitor, it doesn't allow me to put nationality information. Please fix it. Zero star..	1

13897	Good and neat tracking app however battery gone flat within 6 hours,	1
13898	Update: 1) Under Favourites, list should appear based on your location. Already the app takes note of user's location, so why can't Favourites list be included. 2) There should be a notification to remind users to check out after, for example, every 6 hours or so.	1
13899	Once dnld, hp become slow, prompted low memory, battery dropped faster its ran background non stop n we cannot stop it only can pause, but it still consumed battery backend! unless use force stop in app manager. Please make it can stop or exit Apps once not in use!	1

13901	The App is great and user friendly. Huge thanks to the developer.	0
13902	Good	0
13903	Currently, this only works for those of us with a telco subscription. Would be useful for those transient or work permit workers who don't subscribe to the aforementioned service but are dependent on wifi for their wechat, line or whatsapp communication using their mobile devices. Pls offer this in Chinese too.	1
13904	With the new timelime breakdowns per county this has become the app I wanted. Would be great to have push notifications on home screen to check-in for when I forget to do so in the app itself.	0
13905	Much improved app with a lot of relevant information. Still slightly draining on batteries though	0

13914	Great app. Nice and simple. Would love to see 2 features added: 1. If you opt to check in but forgot, it sends a notification asking or reminding. 2. Include a section for HSE news updates and any changes implemented by the government, so everyone has one source of truth.	0

13925	i sleep and wake up in the next morning, i have 100 plus exchange??!! i stay at top floor and corner unit...end up each day i have 200 to 400 exchange aft the new update, i think this is not realistic n increase workload of 'filtering' subsequently. also, seemingly consume more power than earlier version before the new update, it showed a relative 'real' contact number per day, abt 20 to 40, for my case.	1
13926	Getti g "Invalid phone number" for a working Australian number!!!	1

13929	Very good app & much needed.	0
13930	App dont seem to work. I was sent the pin to key in but kept prompting me invalid pin. I uninstall and reinstall still same problem.	1
13931	How do you even log in? When you first open the app it asked you for your name and age range followed by sending you a PIN to your SMS. When you go to your SMS to get the pin and go back into CovidSafe app the pin no longer works because you start from the beginning again which is an endless cycle. How does anyone even log into this?	1
13932	Sir I take order from hunger but app is black please help me sir	1
13933	Using just because we are being forced. Useless. Even govt. does not know who created it. BS	1

13935	Dear Sir, facing issue cannot open the app. Facing some issue in app. Is there any upgrade or bugs fixing in process?	1
13936	After downloading the app, my iPhone overheated on several occasions and had to be temporary disabled so as to reduce the temperature. The overheating issue disappeared after I deleted the app.	1

13947	Crashes constantly and drains battery. Also, main screen indicates need to upgrade despite being on the latest release. Updated review: just updated to the latest release today 30 June 2020 at 9pm, APP does not work indicating it "could not get APIKey".	1
13948	not in English - thus useless	1
13949	I cannot download it. Any update happening in app? \ud83d\ude14	1

13958	Good	0
13959	Radius alert and some other features are not working in my region. Solve these problems. By the way app is very good. Good efford my govt.pk.	1
13960	It doesn't accept my mobile so I can't get the PIN. Read the other posts this isn't an issue anymore. Was easy to download and is running on my phone now:)	1
13961	This app causes my handphone to keep restarting. It wrote itself into memory and crashes my handphone!	1
13962	A very simple and important app. Most of my other apps collect my data so that it can be sold to advertising companies. This one will hopefully prevent and slow the spread of a global pandemic. Seems worthwhile to me.	0
13963	I downloaded the app on July 31 and then received an alert on August 4 that I was near someone within the last 14 days, for at least 15 minutes, who tested positive. Since the app had only been released for a few days, and whomever I was near who had tested positive, would have had to indicate so in the app, in this case, would the time period only be since July 31? The time stamp in the Exposure log, indicates a matched key count at 3:06 pm on August 4. That’s the only match in my log. I was at home at that time and nobody else in my household had the app installed. I’m also curious about the indication of being close (within 2 meters) to someone for at least 15 minutes. That’s a long time and would assume that someone who had reported being positive in the app would not be out and about anyway, unless they have no conscience. I got tested August 5 and have been self-isolating since while waiting for my results. Appreciate any feedback you can provide.	1
13964	Safe app	0
13965	Why stop	1
13966	I can't open this app	1
13967	I always thought of technology as something to be scared of. This app changed my view in so many ways. With this I can protect my fellow earth dweller as well as myself form a life threatening virus. I deeply admire the makers of this amazing app! Thank you thank you thank you	0
13968	Waiting for OTP almost an hour but still nothing	1
13969	Bad	1
13970	App should be available in English. International Travelers are a big risk factor and they need to be able to use the app. So even before accepting to any terms and conditions it needs to be possible to change to english and maybe some other languages. Otherwhise the app is useless.	1
13971	Not able to log in. Its mentioning - an error has occured. account creation failed	1
13972	Its a amezing app for citizen and resident and who ever leving in the kingdom of bahrain to have the gov and the medical staff to indentify and locate new cases and to stop the spread the virus must have app on your phone for your owne safty and health.	0
13973	A very useful app to prevent covid spreading.	0
13974	I am coming from canada. I was told I need to download this app. I want to know how to get OTP if I don't own any india number. Out of curiosity I want to know how to use internet at the airport. That requires OTP with indian mobile number. Dec06/2020 I am sure I have not explained rocket science so you canâ€™t understand. As simple as if I canâ€™t use international number to start the app how am I supposed to use it.	1
13975	Good	0
13976	Otp is not being sent. Cannot register.	1
13977	Easy to install. Works ok. For an app financed by belgian authorities I would have expected a multilingual (Fr, Nl, G) interface... This will increase adoption rate !	0

13982	Application is excellent, that allows options for generating permits, giving notification alerts of covid cases in the region, boundary limits of permits, reporting option for suspected covid cases etc. Nice user friendly one. The difficulty found is it is not showing dependents who are in visit visa, and no option for adding them.	0
13983	What the hell? It's just show unknown, i try to reinstall, log out and log in again is the same, this is the app from government developer class? What a shame. Now i can't go anywhere cause of this	1
13984	Excellent app	0
13985	It is not working anymore	1

13987	A very informative effort. Very good	0
13988	Update: now scanning with singpass requires this app but nothing happens ie cannot sign in. Doesnt take up much battery and no data usage required. Great job! Friend cant install on S10 though (mines note 10 and works fine).	1

13997	Excellent	1
13998	Like many other as of the 8th of August my phone is overheating and the battery being drained within an hour or so, the only warning coming up is for this app. Was working very well but not as of Saturday. I don't want to delete but may have to if it keeps draining the battery and overheating	1
13999	Good	0
14000	Great	0
14001	Most important thing here is that it helps to keep us safe and allow things to start opening up - that's the top priority of this. Some feedback is that it's causing music and casting to stutter on a regular basis - concerned that some people might delete because of this.	0
14002	Not working after last update...	1

14009	The very help ful	0
14010	App started rapidly draining battery in a matter of hours since 8 Aug. The only way to stop it was to uninstall Google play services updates and re install them when prompted by the Covid tracker app. Seems to have done the trick.	1
14011	Good	0
14012	Not working	1
14013	This app was fine until Google started forcing you to turn on location before the Exposure Notification would work. I rarely use location so now my choices are let Google track my every move or switch off Exposure Notifications. Not happy	1
14014	eat my battery auto shutdown thankyou	1
14015	Major issue with connecting to my smartwatch after installing covidsafe. Had to uninstall the app to reconnect my watch. I have a pixel 3a paired to a fossil 5.	1

14028	I can't receive the OTP on my number how can i register?	1
14029	Great App	1
14030	Useless cannot get pin number to logon keeps saying my number is invalid	1
14031	If your notifications aren't showing properly, go to Settings->Notifications->COVIDSafe and toggle off "Foreground Service". This will disable the "currently active" notification, but the app will continue running as intended. Devs should really fix this though; there's people who will uninstall the app because of this.	1
14032	Most lousy app I ever see. Bluetooth running in background is drain my battery fast. Erase immediately after I install it. It suck!	1
14033	My bluetooth suddenly cannot function when I try to activate the trace together apps. I am using oppo r11s. I call oppo help desk but was ask to bring down my phone to troubleshoot the problem. Not sure is it due to the apps?	1
14034	Good	0
14035	Good app	0
14036	Battery Killer. It's overusing the Google Play Services framework and it consumes a crazy amount of battery, almost 32% of battery usage was from it. I appreciate the commitment to trace and protect us against COVID exposure, but it's of no use if it just drains the battery and you can't even use it.	1
14037	I cannot register. Keep telling me something wrong with my network. Ask to try again	1

14065	I think there needs to be the option for using non-singapore numbers since there are many foreigners in Singapore.	1

14086	Workers need to install TraceTogether before they can be cleared to go back to work, but the app is uncompatible on their (older) samsung phone! Understand from an earlier feedback post that the TraceTogether team is aware and working on it, but really hope it can be expedited!

14097	Great	0
14098	In reply to the developers, I hope this helps. My mobile is Samsung Note 20 and using sony wf-1000xm3 for my Bluetooth earpiece. I am beginning to feel that other brands might also be facing the same thing. This means Trace together is lagging or cutting off the sound. If you don't do something, these major brands might start questioning if their customers have to choose between the earpiece or trace together. Hope you can do something. I had shared what....	1
14099	Good. Download it peeps and get Australia back to work.	0
14100	The constant notification in the notification bar is very annoying. Like... I think I might uninstall it because of that. It keeps trucking my thinking I have an actual notification, and shows up on my lock screen too.	1

14103	SafeEntry check-ins and outs are smooth and fast. But the app really eats into the battery life. It suddenly depleted almost 60% of my phone battery in about 8 hours overnight last night. Please do something about it. Uninstalling in the meantime.	1

14129	Another LNP government fail.I have tried at least 20 times to register but every time I have been told I'm entering an 'invalid phone number' Rubbish. I will keep trying and if it does work I might adjust my stars but at this point it doesn't seem to be working at all for me. Note: tried my work phone also and having same issue.. maybe it's a traffic/server issue.	1

14145	So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.	0
14146	Thanks for keeping us healthy	0
14147	Works fine, pity it doesn't give the daily numbers and general locations of new cases. The new numbers are added to the overall graph but I can't zoom in to recent days.	0
14148	App admin can you please have a look on some app errors? I installed and filled all details and everything correctly filled but when I open its asking questionnaire ans i answered all after that its showing saved all but still its coming same . Not able to login please advise us.	1
14149	Doesn't alert you to infected cases in your area. Drains battery pretty fast due to Bluetooth connection. Not sure how this app is supposed to work as there's not much info coming from it. Also don't think personal data will be a concern for public health measures if it means improvement for the app. Just add a consent check box. Whoever wants to download obviously have no worries to share personal data by telco.	1

14155	While the app is a great start, there should be a way to turn the beacon off or maybe have an hourly/manually update option like the weather widget.

14169	Took this off my phone due to privacy also i did not like the fact of it requiring bluetooth as it should have nothing to do with tracking a virus who or what does it want me to connect to? Also what has asking permission to my camera, microphone and contacts got to do with it. Final verdict too many shady things going on with this app	1
14170	I have tried to install it, I am told it is already installed I have no icons on phone to indicate installation. Too hard I give up. On the official site there is lots of information but no links, I used SA Govt site, incredibly frustrating,going in circles. Get it right.	1
14171	Deleting this app due to the recent news that this apps data was "incidently" collected by intelligence agencies for 6 months when they not supposed too!! I now feel that our privacy is not safe with this government's app and handling of this data leak.	1
14172	Unfortunately SMS verification doesn't work outside Turkey, I'm trying from Belarus. This is preventing me from buying airplane tickets. Hope it can be resolved in short time.	1
14173	The app does not even open for me. It just says that EHTERAZ keeps stopping. I have tried turning on my location, my bluetooth but it is still not opening. If the app does not open there is no point of having it.	1
14174	My phone used to need charging every 2 to 3 days as its a work phone. Now from 100% to 20% batt only half a day. Seriously? The new version of adding feature to inform user availability of a new version? Honestly it's a waste of time and resources isn't it? U load it up and google play store will inform all users there's a new update.... why do the double job?	1

14187	Invasion of privacy. Definitely will uninstall after left the place.	1
14188	This app is really helpful to everyone especially those who are spending hours outside their homes because it can easily detect the confirmed cases near you by just turning on your bluetooth.	0

14204	It's so strange why the developers have developed such a simple app that requires ios 13.15 or newer \nAnyone on iPhone 6 or below can not use the app. The government has spend so much money but it would really worth it as more half of the users can not even get it on their phone.	1
14205	A good theory, but in practice was far less than perfect. Since activating the app the Bluetooth on my phone keeps turning off automatically after 5-10 minutes, which both negates the usefulness of the app and makes using Bluetooth devices far too impractical. Due to these problems I have decided to remove the app from my phone.	1

14220	NOTE to those experiencing battery drain, you can FIX this by a) installing this app, b) clearing Google Play Services cache, c) restarting your phone, then d) reinstalling this app. Over the last few days my phone battery was getting slaughtered just like everyone else's; after completing these steps, this app is back to using a fraction of a percent	1

14379	An excellent initiative. An app that can help us to have a better control of COVID-19 infections is always a helping hand to our magnificent doctors, nurses, medical staff and other frontline workers.	0
14380	Good app, keeping me safe. I am happy so far.	0
14381	Why does it keep asking me to upgrade after I have upgraded.	1
14382	Nice	0
14383	Insane battery usage. Even when I'm sitting at home.	1
14384	It has run seamlessly since being installed with no noticeable impact on battery life.	1
14385	I am not sure if this app works but it definitely drains battery using Bluetooth. Requesting below updates for better performance: 1. Use location services to let user define home location. 2. If users are at home then Bluetooth and other app functions can take a break and give phone battery some rest. 3. Let users know if there are any active covid19 patients or potential patient who is advised for strict home quarantine in the vicinity of 100 meters.	1
14386	Unable to register. After giving password it says something went wrong please try again later. Please fix	1
14387	Full of potential. Need more advanced features...maps, alert when surrounded by other people using the same apps..etc.	1
14388	Absolute useless! Ireland is an island... This app should run in conjunction with the Ireland app to be anywhere near useful... The virus doesn't stop at the border!! Ive been using the Ireland app which is brilliant... Sorry but this is a wasted opportunity.	1

14410	Hi,.thanks for the app, please ignore the idiots. Just wondering if it will be updated to access the Google exposure notification system? Thanks!	1
14411	Very easy to set up, and asks for very little info. Doesn't even need you to give your exact age, let alone birthday. It'll save lives but only if you and many others get the app.	0

14447	Very bad	1
14448	Good luck	0
14449	How can we use this app for non camera phone? Are you able to add something for copy and paste of the location address? Like the Safe Entry Access.	1
14450	The app is frustrating Not worth the hype. Showing wrong "credentials" although it was working well initially. People have jobs and flights to catch. The support team is non existent and keeping mum....annoyed and irritated	1
14451	Brilliant app	0
14452	Its to good for everyone	0
14453	Have to delete it on trips in my car where I use Bluetooth for music as it keeps unpairing with the stereo. Otherwise I assume it's doing what it's supposed to. Anything to get out of this lockdown mess.	1
14454	Many importen	0
14455	Easy to set up	0
14456	well done for the rapid Safe Entry scanning. Other than that, I'm not interested as to my exposure. Causing unnecessary panic to some users that I know personally. Unless data to me. I've installed 2 times and uninstalled after a week's usage each time. Power consumption was over 30%. My phone drained flat in less than 5 hours which otherwise can use up to 14 hours. Confirmed this and uninstalled.	1

14466	\u2018Error verifying phone number. \u2018 ummm...so it\u2019s not actually working.	1
14467	The pause function is good. But only 3 choices on the duration If can improve or revamp to this part, i think the take ip rate will be even better. As majority are still encourage to Work from Home ( WFH), so the app is useful only when we step out of our home, and should be turn off when we are home. Dont your agree? So can consider having a simpler "turn on/ turn off button".. And just remind user when we go out, turn it on, just like we put on mask only when we go out of house.. Cheers	1

14480	Need to address battery drain issue .. and show its usage in the battery usage chart Need to allow automatic (probably GPS based) turning off when at home Need to have clearer icon on notification panel to indicate whether if the app is running.

14530	This app interferes with the connection of Bluetooth devices and removed some functions of my music app. I had to uninstall TraceTogether and my music app, and re-install the music app to regain the functions. But somehow the Bluetooth connection is no longer the same as before. I never had any issues with my Bluetooth connections previously but there are constant breaks and jerks in the music now every few seconds, even after uninstalling this app. It broke my Galaxy S8 plus. \ud83d\ude21	1

Stop being a stick in the mud and use the API's, even the German Gov is using the Google & iOS API's. Until you get off your high horse and start using the API's designed by the manufacturer for this sole purpose no one in their right mind will use this abomination of an application.	1

14599	I'm disappointed. When I entered my info in, they constantly say that they are temporarily unavailable. I gave one star, as I feel that this shouldn't happen. If there is some maintenance going on, I feel that informing people about that will make the experience with the app better.	1

14614	Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my husband's and my phones.	1

14633	Nice	0
14634	The app seems to be working OK, but with a heavy drain on the battery. The source code has been published once, but is not being updated with subsequent releases. That's simply not good enough! Feedback from the technical community about vulnerabilities and other bugs is being largely ignored. For now I'll be holding off on installing any updates. I will be removing the app soon if the code scrutiny situation doesn't improve.	1
14635	Fairly easy to register!	1

14667	It's not working, Bluetooth is constantly being shut off. Uninstall the app and now my my Bluetooth is working fine. If you want everyone to download this for safety make sure it works across all platforms first.	1
14668	Of 500k+ installs, only about 120,700 people 'checked in' today to report symptoms. Seems unlikely to be of any help to the current climate as a result.	1

14672	Apple & Google have working systems now that would make COVID tracking work. Why persist with this \u201cold\u201d system? Yes .. it was a great idea. But .. now that Apple & Google are building it into their operating systems, trying to keep this old system operational is crazy	0
14673	Not proper timely upgrades	1
14674	Covid safe needs to recognizes the house you live in so it can turn of bluetooth and location so it doesn't drain the battery. it should be able tell if you're at home based on your home wifi connection.	0
14675	Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.	0

14700	A few days ago, this app started draining my battery. I was out on the Bay when I noticed my phone shut down. Had I gotten into trouble out there, I would have been unable to call for assistance. I couldn't shut off the app so I had to uninstall it. Please let us know when this is fixed. I tried to write a second review but I can only edit my first one. I reinstalled the app after I learned that the problem was fixed. Except now I can't use the Covid check-in feature because I had to re-input my profile yet it won't let me confirm changes to my profile. The button just doesn't work. Aaaargh!	1

14710	This is very good initiative by the government. It will help not only help to find out the active cases around you but also initiate the post lockdown measures in a effective way. I just wish if it can be available in English too. :)	0
14711	Drains battery, phone dies within 3 hours of unplugged but can see its benefits	1
14712	Why does the app need to run in background with Bluetooth on 24/7? Counterintuitive app.	1
14713	Won't be downloaded	1
14714	Since last update I now need to have bluetooth AND location on. I was sceptical with having Bluetooth on all the time, but now adding location. Sorry but i want to do everything to keep Aust safe from Covid but I'm not keeping my location on 24/7. Why did this change!!??	1

14722	Great is concept however it doesn't appear to work on my phone. For some reason the app keeps turning the Bluetooth off on my phone. Will bump up to 5 stars when a fix is rolled out.	0

14753	This app always says tha the device is rooted even my device isn't rooted.... I have checked it using root checker app that the "Root access isn't installed on this device" but yet this "Arogya Setu" app says "You can't use this device due to Security restriction (rooted device)" Even my device isn't rooted .....

14774	Initially didn't recognize the phone number. Now requires permissions which most likely will ruin my battery very quickly. Was it the only practical way to achieve the purpose?	1
14775	Works well. It Sufficiently protects personal data and is stored on your own phone for 21 days. The permanent notification in the drawer is annoying. I guess they have to cater for all the old phones out there too. A setting to turn it off though would be great.	0
14776	Saves more battery than the last version	1
14777	I downloaded the CovidSafe application to Nokia 9 OS: Pie. There seems to be no initial problems with the program. However, there is no Exposure Notification badge. It reacts to the deactivation of Bluetooth, via silent notification. Reminder: To activate when you leave home or visit a public place. There is no threat to device security, the app has limited access. Our hyena or wessel-trait individual's wouldn't declare themselves sick, unless hospitalised. Review by Protonumus [YouTube]	1
14778	,my request not close and i cant do any requeat and I can not do a counseling ? and 22092424 no body answer	1
14779	I really want to support this as I believe in a community response to coronavirus, but this isn't it. There are known issues with iOS, so it's unlikely that I'm getting contact info from any iPhones. I've always had Bluetooth enabled (watch, car audio) but this app doesn't play with other devices, continuously dropping audio being the easiest example.	1
14780	Difficulty registering my phone number at first (probably due to traffic). Closed it and tried again later no problem. Works fine	1
14781	Please make this dark mode compatible. My phone is dark mode, so the text in your app is white on a bright yellow background. Unreadable.	1

14784	Doesn't work in the US. It's there a way to update it so we can use it in the USA also? Is anyone making a version for the US?	1
14785	Very innovative and privacy preserving approach, however communication could be improved. For example why in addition to keeping active Bluetooth i also need to keep activate Location services. I found the answer (on Android platform detecting proximity with bluetooth always requires enabling location services) but it could be explained in "How it works?" section as well. Another point to highlight to gain more trust is that it was developed as open source effort without anyone getting paid.	0

14870	Too invasive. It's mandated by the government and can't download on older smartphones. Not everyone can afford to buy a new phone! Must reconfigure for devices less than ios 13 and android systems less than 7.	1
14871	It makes me feel worried when requesting location, although it claimed android needs location turned on for Bluetooth to work. I have downloaded it for quite a few weeks now, but never feel comfortable to fulfill the registration. I don't really trust Google/ android for not collecting data from 3rd party. For financial reason i cannt go for apple. I turned all android & google account location off. I will proceed once the technical issue can be resolved to use Bluetooth without location on.	1
14872	App crashes after it deactivate itself. Only solution is to delete data. I did three times but then you lost the tracking of the last days. Useless like this.	1

Drains battery life (using an S9+) like a glutton. Please fix!! P.S. Will be resorting to using the Token instead because of the abovementioned issues soon.	1
14937	I like that it has the constant notification to remind me to use the app. Otherwise I'd forget to switch it on when I leave the house.	1

14944	While registering to the App, I've tried to read the Terms and Conditions but it kept kicking me out and I'm not willing to register if I'm unable to read what's written. Please clarify and hope this issue to be fixed. Despite my experience, I've heard a lot of good feedback about this app so 3 would be fine until I personally use it.	1
14945	It doesn't have segregated data at provincial level, doesn't provide you comparison charts among provinces, not shows the areas with dense covid cases etc	1

14966	Very disappointed in app and have uninstalled. Could not turn off the alert or have this as a choice. Never use or used bluetooth and is a very annoying function that keeps want to link to devices. Federal government has not provided follow up detail on how it works for privacy/security	1

14970	This app is really good if you want to be updated about the latest updates in bahrain but I'm isolating myself it's been 1 week and a half and I used to receive notifications that my location was detected but it's been 2 days and it has not been detected now so just asking if u are still detecting my location	0

14975	I could not transfer files to my phone through bluetooth anymore. Due to company policy for high security I cannot use a tumbdrive to transfer files to the purchasing PC. My only way was through bluetooth but now I can't even use it after I installed this app. I was ok with the app until I needed bluetooth for work and this app is affecting me big time. :( please help rectify this issue. Also please have other languages be available, older generations need this app more and can't english.	1
14976	It helps	0
14977	Scam and spam... Unfortunately uninstalled.	1
14978	Installed on the first go. No problems there. I have no issues the the surveillance conspiracies. But had to re-rate the app because it interferes with my podcast-to-car connection, and keeps turning off my podcast. So whenever I'm in the car, I have to force-stop the app so I can listen. And so sometimes I forget to turn it back on when I get out of the car.	1

14987	It was good for a laugh, I guess. I don't know who on earth programmed it, but it's... Incomplete. Many of the sentences within it are simply not finished (but if you want to "read terms &" or declare yourself to be "I am 16 or", you're in luck!) and frankly the lack of location/venue check-in and reliance on bluetooth means that this app is basically worthleaa for its intended purpose as well. Do better, HSCNI.	1

15012	Excellent. Thanks and Salam.	0
15013	Very poorly implemented App. Have a look at apps like Tile which implement background Bluetooth well. Cannot use audio devices while this App is enabled.	1
15014	This should be mandatory for anyone in Singapore to have on their phone! Nice to see technology being useful for this outbreak!	0
15015	Although I\u2019m not sold on this helping as much as they claim but we gotta try. I mean we\u2019ve all sold our backsides to google, Facebook etc already. This app collects less data that those so although Im big on privacy, I can\u2019t argue against this whilst still using google and Facebook. Which I do. Let\u2019s beat the damn rona!!!!	0
15016	The battery drain is unprecedented. If I want to use only safe entry this app doesn't allow, it needs Bluetooth by default. Instead make it optional, if we are running low on battery at least we can make use of safe entry to check in or out. It is all or nothing at present that is one of the reasons people are reluctant to use it and rue about it.	1
15017	After using it, it slow down my mobile phone and my apps seems slow to respond. pls improve the usability.	1

I installed it again and now it is not letting me registering showing error in requesting otp..really time wasting exercise. Idea is good but implementation really bad	1
15044	Not recognising my mobile number so I can't register	1
15045	I only downloaded the app because my Internet service provider sent me an SMS stating someone with the app had tested positive and was in close proximity to me. However the app didn't update with the information, which should be an option in the settings. Didn't have the app for more than 5 minutes so I can't properly judge, but it didn't work for me	1
15046	The app interrupts Bluetooth function between phone and my windows 10 operating system Bluetooth setup.	1
15047	Echoing comments on interfering with other Bluetooth devices. Wireless earphones are continually connecting/disconnecting due to the app tabulating the Bluetooth interactions it has. Makes connecting with other Bluetooth devices unusable. This has only become apparent as of the most event update.	1

15057	It keeps saying something is wromg again and again and again. Honestly given up on this app lah	1
15058	Honestly very concerned with the accuracy and reliability of this app, particularly in reference to how how regularly it checks for exposure. Upon receiving weekly notifications regarding my exposure, I notice regularly that the last check hasn't occurred in days. On instances where I have been socialising I have noticed that 0 checks had occurred on these days while checks do seem to occur when I'm in bed sleeping... Very concerned with accuracy and regularity of checking for exposure .	1
15059	Rubbish, installed on two Samsung Galaxy J4 plus mine ans wifes. Hers work fine, my app download has never worked even when removed and reinstalled.	1
15060	App ok but kills battery	1
15061	All working fine now.	0
15062	An extraordinary virus can only be combatted with extraordinary efforts. This app is a huge step towards stopping the spread. Hope more people will download and use it to maximise its effectiveness.	0
15063	Spastics are scared of it but my google home, siri and Alexa are way more insecure than this.	1
15064	not good for mobile	1
15065	Easy to install and setup, runs well. \n\nOdd that the app requires email authentication as this seems to be a big issue for some users when they could just authenticate via text like other apps do...	0
15066	The latest version of this app on my Motorola G7 is all good - battery life, connectivity to Bluetooth, and operation of other apps (issues reported by other users) all normal. The previous version meant I had to manually connect to other Bluetooth devices, but I wasn't experiencing any dropouts so it was worth the minor inconvenience. Would recommend people at least try it on their mobile for the possible future benefit of yourself and others.	0

Uninstalling and hope you fools realise you should never trust a government who let the virus in. Plebiscite, bushfires, covid 19 what more proof do you need idiots!!!!	1
15071	Unable to register. OTP didn't work. I input into the app the exact code received via SMS but the app says invalid code	1
15072	Very inconvenience. Apps must be very simple. Leaving a leaving and closing. Don't us to scan again and again.	1

15078	Useless and battery consuming app. We can't rely upon aarogya setu app only.	1
15079	The data provided within the app isn't necessarily useful. There is a county by county breakdown, showing *total* number *since the beginning* of the pandemic. At this point these numbers provide no useful information, instead 14 day averages or five day averages, per 100K population should be shown, as these would give residents an indication of how their area is faring. In addition, the breakdown could be done on a council basis.	1

15084	Useless app. Drains the battery very fast. Update 22 Oct - My child was forced to install because of school. Built in scanner is pathetic. Had to repeatedly attempt to scan 10+ times before it worked. Drained 25% of battery in 2hrs+. New Samsung Galaxy S20+ with latest firmware still have this issue. Update 23 Oct - Just noticed the app asks for permissions to know precise location and to read contents of storage card. WTH????	1
15085	Hi, need some help as the app keeps telling me that i have a network issue when all my other apps and internet are working fine. Can't get past the OTP stage.	1
15086	It's application is unless for work and each & every central government undertaking office to forces everyone to download this app.	1
15087	I have installed and unistalled numerous times on both my phones and get same message EVERY time..app temporarily not working try again later...this has been same since day 1 of app being avaliable And of course as with all sg customer services they say sorry but give no resolution	1
15088	Good initiative but something needs to be done very quickly about the battery draining.	0
15089	I've uninstalled the Covid tracker - it's on my business phone, which is where I need it and i lost business when phone power completely drained & phone automatically switched off.	1
15090	Worst ever, keeps closing automatically and does not complete the registration, problem with OTP always. Even when it was working fine before the update	1
15091	Not working.. I can't register eventhough I got the code and shows an error	1
15092	It's doesn't work.	1
15093	Still learning stage.	1
15094	I had a contact alert at 6:00pm.  The next morning it was gone.  Was this a false alarm? If not the alarm should remain in the app until the user removes it.  Had I not been near my phone and gone to bed without checking it, as I often do, I would have missed the alert.  I fully believe in the concept of this app. However, I do think a narrower time frame should be noted in the alarms.  Even if I was informed that the exposure was in the previous 5 days or prior to that would be beneficial for monitoring for symptoms.	1
15095	Amazing	0
15096	your latest updates got a bug. keeps getting this "connected to Null", then "Disconnected from Null" messages. the messages will appear very often. Tested and confirm to be this app, because the messages stopped appearing once I force stop the app.	1

15126	The app is hopelessly inadequate. It hijacks/confuses GPS and even my phone does not know where it is. It does not recognize certain phone numbers (mine works, my wife's doesn't, and many of my acquaintances report the same) and after repeated attempts to bring this to the developers' attention they just keep sending FAQs that insult one's intellect., Like, "the app only works with mobile phone numbers" and so on. If this app is our only hope for returning to normal, we are in dire straits.	1

15147	I installed the app to do my part in trace mapping but it is sucking my battery dry and I'm considering uninstalling it again just so my phone lasts through the day without recharging twice. Absurd. When I'm home (which is 95% of the time), and I turn off bluetooth, the app should completely shut down. Give me the control to turn it on and off when I need rather than using all my battery even when it's apparently off (which of course it certainly is not). This should be a simple fix. Please do this ASAP! It's turning people off and defeating the whole purpose of it's existence.	1

15194	Battery Drainer Application	1
15195	I only downloaded this app because to enter cinemas you'll need to use TraceTogether from 16 Nov onwards and so I downloaded it and when you enter you particulars it just shows "Temporarily Unavailable" all the time I'm unable to use TraceTogether so honestly I think this app definitely contains a lot of bugs and needs to be improved. Honestly super disappointed because it's not the first time it has happened to me.	1
15196	Draining my battery, I'm seriously considering uninstalling this app, I can be left without battery at an instant, it's a disaster. Fix it or its purpose will be defeated.	1
15197	The app didn't install	1

15202	i wld actually give a 5 stars if this app didn't ruin my day today. i was forced to download this app just to get into the cinema. but when i tried putting in my particulars, "temporarily unavailable" rlly? pls lah, dont force others to use if the app is not 100% useful leh. just bc of the "temporarily unavailable" i cldnt watch my damned movie and had to ask for a refund. is this how the gov works? give their citizens more trouble?	1
15203	Non effective	1

15205	The app keep stopping on my phone, please how do I go about it?	1
15206	Good app	0
15207	It used to work fine but after the recent update the number of bluetooth exchanges per day is reduced dramatically.	1
15208	Very good app	0
15209	Useless, can't enter required details.	1
15210	The app seems to work fine, but there are some UX problems and going from the dev comments there won't be a fix. Here are some of the issues I could cram in 500 words: - The intro should be visual without too much text so less tech savvy people won't be afraid to keep it installed. I have an IT background, but I know a lot of people that don't get it. - Have a language selection IN THE APP. My phone is set up for English, but I want this app to be displayed in Dutch.	1
15211	Great and simple	0
15212	Very good	0
15213	Installed to be a good citizen and then couldn't connect to car blue tooth anymore. If you going to make an invasive app make sure it doesn't mean with everyday use.	1
15214	Nice healthy	0
15215	This app does not give realtime data of which locations have covid-19 cases. Not recommended as it have no functional usage.	1

15226	The system won't recognize my mobile number. Can't register \u2639\ufe0f	1
15227	Its a horrible app. Let me explain : I have downloaded and used this app 24/7 for couple of months.. I live in covid hotspot area (Mohammadpur). Sometimes I have to go outside for grocery and buying medicines. It Didn't gave any worning or anything at all. Even I had to go ibn sina hospital for health checkup. The hospital was crowded with corona patients but still the app says no contact detected. This app is A joke for us. (I always use Data Whenever I go outside and run this app 24/7)	1
15228	I think including on the app how many have downloaded, plus how many have activated settings would be useful to show uptake. Continue to publicly encourage usage. Also note children of a very young age have phones and tablets to be utilized with parental/guardian permission. App should be for island of Ireland.	0
15229	Very nice app	0
15230	I can not login.. After entering my ID and password and the code. Received message says: something went wrong, please try again	1

15240	Initial review with the first release was bad. However, after the ongoing updates most the issues where addressed and it is a perfect application for the current situation. Challenging though to convince people to install it since they're worried about privacy which should not be a big deal for the purpose this app delivers and how it could save you	1
15241	Good	0
15242	Good app, but the texts need to auto shrink on some phones. I tried to install on my parents phone (Samsung s10), they had extra large fonts on their phone. The part where we need to key in the phone number cannot be seen, I can't scroll down not shrink it. I have to to go the phone settings to reduce the size. If people didn't know the work around, they would assume the app can't be used.	0
15243	Latest update is causing battery drain issue... Please fix this issue ASAP	1
15244	Nice application	0
15245	Good	0
15246	I've had two different exposure point, two months apart, that both sent me to quarantine. The app didn't pick up on either one, I found out about them myself.	1

15256	It is a really helpful app keeping you safe from Covid19	0
15257	Great experience! The success of this app depends on the huge number of users of Bangladesh. The more user the better.	0
15258	Yes I agree I want to congratulate the whole team for introduction of "EHTERAZ APP" also the effort taken by Ministry of Health & thankfullly appreciate MOPH role in handling to stop this Pandemic Coronavirus COVID-19 spread in State of Qatar.	0

15263	When scan QR Code, the error message is Not recognized as Safe Entry QRCode. But I have been using this app to scan the same place almost daily. What is going on?	1
15264	I need covid certificate	1
15265	Keep saying one time password will send to me for setting up but never received anything. Have been tried to register for the whole day...	1
15266	Garbage battery draining app. Don't even deserve 1 star.	1
15267	There's no instructions, no explanations, the ToS you have to accept, but can't read it. The battery is drained insanely fast, meaning i have to have my phone fully charged before going outside; not to mention that it slowly kills the phone in this way. And to top it all off, it requires access to photos and calls, which makes no sense at all or it won't start - people are spending money and waiting in queues just to get burner phones to protect their privacy. Is anybody looking into this issue?	1
15268	The constant run on background cause phone to lag and causes difficulties in unlocking phone. I appreciate the intentions of the app, I have no intention of not using it but please developers iron out the issues. I'm using s20+.	1
15269	Not useful	1
15270	The consultation form asks like 50 unrelevant questions before you can actually submit consultation form. This app was much better when I used it few months ago.	1
15271	Good	0
15272	The app was working great until it updated now when I try to log in all I get is that there is an internet connection error. My internet is fine and I just can't log in.	1
15273	Nice	0
15274	Invalid phone number message error. Regardless if you include a 0 before the number or not, once it says your phone number is invalid you are stuck. Also why include +61 in the number given that it is only for Australia.	1
15275	The app is great does not drain my battery and it is definitely working	0
15276	Has potential to help future researchers in a small way. Probably won't keep YOU safe now. If you can followup the indicators or hints it gives that might be useful. About as useful as a bluetooth STI tracker for sex workers.	1
15277	Want phase 3? Better download this app and show to big brother.	1
15278	I hope it works. I only got a notification that my test results were negative in the app, but those results cannot be found anymore. People keep aski g for your test result, but they are not to be found in the app anymore..Did not receive sms.	1
15279	Good	0
15280	There is no interaction with the app on how it works and why the GPS signal is needed (drains more battery). But you only need to install a GPS emulator app to report a fake location if privacy is your concern.	1
15281	Not good working	1
15282	So nice app	0

15288	Useless app. Zap my battery life from 100% to 0% within 1 hour. Every time I pass by somebody, the Bluetooth function went berserk and start sending proximity signals nonstop. Really funny app worse than Pok\u00e9mon go.	1
15289	My phone number is invalid? Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this?	1
15290	No other language than Polish...	1
15291	Please fix Huawei Nova 7i to receive OTP & without Google play service I have try several time uninstall & install again , when i key in my phone number still cant get otp page, please fix it	1
15292	Constantly interfering with Bluetooth for other devices such as my Square Reader (payment terminal), solar smart charger and solar inverter. I'm having to force close the covidsafe app when taking payment from my passengers in my chauffeur (hire car) business.	1
15293	Interferes with Bose 700 Bluetooth headphones so had to disable location permission.	1
15294	It is good for update the covid cases it is so helpful	0
15295	The apps regional case numbers are a day behind. Dont know why this is but it probably should be more up to date. Other than that the app seems to work well	1

15299	It would be good if you give us detail information. The location, or something like that. And I find out so hard to update the data, always loading and nothing. Also, this morning suddenly the App close by himself, repeatedly. I couldnt update the data until now and I uninstall the app. *sigh*	1

15319	Can't connect stage two .. very hard connect	1
15320	Great app. If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add a push notification once a day asking if you feel okay instead of having to go in manually and update it. Would be a great addition.	0

15329	Meme	1
15330	It's trash I made the test on 20 MAY 2020 and until now no result	1
15331	Initially i thought it to be a good initiative, but it was a myth. At the Helpline number all they do is encourage you to write an email to support email id. Wrong result displayed on the app for the last 2 days despite requesting them and emailing them. A typical sarkari app where people are reluctant to work.	1
15332	Recently, with the recent updates, it has been draining the battery on the phone, quite significantly. I know some apps that collect logs eventually start to consume more power as the logs increase in size. Just a guess	1
15333	Worst app ever created for a government agency. Drained my batt thanks to your app functioning in the background. Disrupt all my other BT connection from my fitbit to my jbl earpiece. Need to keep restarting my phone in order for my other BT devices to be able to be detected by the phone again. The app notification is really annoying. Everytime the notification pops up, my other BT devices got disconnected. Not everyone in SG owns a brand new phone. Be mindful when creating an app for the nation	1
15334	Useless app...always gets log out automatically and then having error in login.	1
15335	Good	0
15336	Amazing app easy to use!	0
15337	Great & essential App. Keep your bluetooth on. Be a life saver, DON'T be a Barnaby	0
15338	Waste of time! Employee at my workplace tested positive. I have had socially distanced contact and not been contacted or notified at all. Waste of taxpayers money not useful at a all	1
15339	All these people complaining that it only supports the latest OS... if your phone is older than the 6S then it’s time to upgrade... your device isn’t supported by Apple, why should it be supported by anyone else?	1
15340	Super	0
15341	Fantastic and accurate thanks for who makes easy	0
15342	Location madatory? Until the last update the app was active as long as bluetooth was enabled. Now it requres the location to be enabled as well. Is this a deviation from the initial design? Is this a breach of trust? People installed the app because the govt assured that people will not be stalked.	1
15343	I tested positive for covid and no one can give me the code to enter the result. This app is not fit for pupose	1
15344	Super.	0
15345	Very good	0
15346	I don't know how this app is saving us where you can only see the numbers of positive or negative. But there isn't any another option that any covid positive is near you withing 5 to 10 mtr and it is not notifying us that "stay alert a person near you is covid positive."	1
15347	The app is not accepting my correct mobile number which i have since 2006. Unable to proceed further in installation.	1
15348	Best app ever. Stay safe.	0
15349	Good	0
15350	DO NOT INSTALL, NOT SAFE This is BAD: it actually requires you to have gps on, this is a breach of privacy It is sadly not avoidable because of how Bluetooth works but I really expected more from a government funded project	1
15351	Why after updated required to uninstall the old one and I became no valid?!!! Please fix it	1
15352	Very bad.	1
15353	All good team, happy to help, my data is available when you need it, and appreciate you asking in bold print. let's face google and Apple have it and hide the request in 1000000 words of 2 font terms and conditions. Go Gov just please bring back the footy Ffs	0
15354	Very straight forward	0
15355	This application cannot be inatalled on the LAVA smartphone becaue this smarthone does not have back and front camera. This is special smartphone to use it on the places, where use cameras is prohibited. Please work under AlHosn apllication and make it able to install on any type of smartphone. Even smartphone does not camera.	1
15356	I have used the app to order my repeat prescription even after the update and found no problems with it, all the pages seem to open OK.	0
15357	Update: After installing the app again on August 11th, it appears to be back working and stable again. Excessive battery drain resolved. Since August 8th this app and Google Play Services are chewing up battery! I'm going to have to uninstall it, I'm losing a percent of battery every 3-4 minutes. The battery usage apps overview shows both this app and Google Play Services (which is tied to the app) as being the biggest battery offenders, using over 45% of the battery in the past 24 hours.	1
15358	Good app	0
15359	Literally went for a 4 km evening run just then with 35% battery on my phone. Phoned died in 15 minutes. Sorry government I'm deleting it. I think it's more dangerous roaming in public without a phone in case of an emergency.	1
15360	Excellent app \ud83d\udc4d	0
15361	Not that good	1
15362	My phone was scorching, i almost went to buy a new phone as my battery was going from 100% to 15% within 2 hours, it was almost too hot to handle at times.. but i seen that this app was actually the issue, i uninstalled it & now my phone is perfect	1
15363	Cool app	0
15364	EDIT: you need to have mobile data on (instesd of just wifi) for the app to confirm and accept your mobile number. ORIGINAL: Can't get beyond the 'invalid phone number' message. I know my phone number is not invalid, yet it won't tell me what is wrong with my number or how I am entering it. I want to do the right thing, but the difficulty I am experiencing in trying to do this is quite dissuading.	1
15365	I cannot register, maybe not yet as Im before travel to JPN. I'm still in GER. To enter to JPN I'm requested to install, but I wonder if it will work if I cannot register.	1
15366	The biggest problem with the cov19 Bluetooth API is that you need to have location on. I don't want to enable GPS all the time, as the app says it self, all apps that have access to location, can use it while enabling location for this app. Don't want GPS enable all the time. I known it's not the apps fault, but googles. Still has a big affecte on who gonna use this app.	1
15367	Amazing	0
15368	Error of getting OTP please fix...	1
15369	Very good	0
15370	The app showing a big question mark on the code. Nothing can be change even uninstall and install.	1

15372	Nice	0
15373	Nice Software	0
15374	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
15375	Lifesaving app.	1

15381	Unable to obtain OTP using my Zero1 mobile line. Have no issue using my Singtel line on the same mobile phone previously.	1
15382	Cant even validate nric properly and expecting usage from population. Did the government not even understand the basic principles of releasing a software application? Called bug testing?	1

15384	I can't seem to sign up at all and it keeps popping up that something went wrong massage even tho everything is correct with the password	1
15385	Apps didn't accept my name and my IC number. It says not valid! How can I be wrong about my own name and IC!? Uninstalling!	1
15386	Absolutely thrashes my battery, on the upside, It's kept me safe from corona	1
15387	Always on keeping myself and others safe	0
15388	Please update your application. And corona patient number attach with gps map. So your app may be useful. And show also red, green or yellow zone patient wise.	1
15389	Not working \ud83d\ude15	1
15390	This app is making my battery draining faster than usual. Also, when I connect my earpods with my bluetooth on, my music gets interrupted as it gets very choppy. I didn't know what was causing it to be choppy till I deleted this app from my phone and everything is back to normal. I would rather use the token instead.	1
15391	Installed on my phone has bugs that need to be fixed stop working every time I change battery optimisation settings to get app to fully work in background and it deactivated the app	1
15392	After updating the app., It always keep stop. Please fix it soon	1
15393	Good	0
15394	Innovative	0
15395	until the latest update, this app was a 4. now I would give it 1. it now disconnects my Bluetooth devices every few minutes which is extremely annoying when you are in the middle of a phone call with Bluetooth headset on.	1
15396	Love the idea and want to help but would be great if I could switch it off while at home to save battery and not have a notification sitting there all the time.	1
15397	I love this app ??	0

15426	Very good and useful. Aarogya Setu can definitely stop spreading of Covid-19 provided the people can understand the significant of introduction of this app.	0
15427	I installed it and had to uninstall it after 2 days as my phone kept glitching. Am trying to install again n it stops at 76%.	1
15428	I kept waiting for one time code during login, tried multiple times, no message ever.	1
15429	Very bad. Give an error (please try again later)	1
15430	This is just an app for tracking and monitoring people. I don't see why an app that's supposed to inform me of a pandemic is asking for access to my files,gallery contacts and location. It also doesn't make any sense when such an app is being forced on us by the authorities to download it. Talk of martial law. This is privacy intrusion in petty manner.	1
15431	Good	0
15432	There's no real point in having this app. The alerts arrive way too late - one arrived with 4 days delay, another one with two days delay. There's also no timestamp, not even approximate one, on when you had this risky encounter. So you can't even reliably localize when you had this risky encounter and whether you should worry, or not.	1
15433	This App is really Nice! working accurately and Fast Reaponse	0
15434	Not a good app to follow, as the COVID radius does not evidence prominent positive cases in an area which may be helpful for people. But it's misleading, exposing general population to infection risk.	1
15435	No useful only time vest	1
15436	I cant use this app. I am on business visa. I dont have Qatar ID. How can use this without id?	1
15437	Keeps crashing	1
15438	The app is very good no doubt but it has a lot of bugs in radius alert	0
15439	Good	0
15440	Can not prove my identity as it won't show my camera the app is no good to me if I can't access the things I need	1

15442	Easy to download and activate on a Samsung S10e. Let's see what happens next.	0
15443	B+. Breakdown by County is never current and sometimes defaults back to April. Other than that it's a very tidy little package.	1

15447	This app is not updated with right and swift information about infected persons. Poor job done for a very good app idea, with govt level resources. They even miss spelling "Islamabad" on a pin location for G-6\1.	1
15448	dangerous app	1
15449	Use up too much battery. Go for work with 100% battery 6hr later battery left with 20%(never touch phone) if i use my phone 6hr already battery flat. And it crash all my other bluetooth device. Like playing music. Suddenly there's crashing sound at random times like your bluetooth is like more then 10 meter away	1
15450	Hope I never need it.	1
15451	Just yesterday i make a test and i didn't get any result and i ask to the people who make a test for me they said it will show in app but when i open app now they said you tried on wrong number try again now i dont know what to do ..	1

15467	I did delete the app but so fare the name still appears instead of the service provided and am not if it really deleted or no \nHow come the app could access the ios and change the setting that way ?!!\nI need to remove it completely	1
15468	Too much annoying\ud83d\ude14 app even after updated to latest version need some bugs to be fixed. App always keeping my display ON resulting too much battery consumption. Earlier i used to charge my mobile hardly 2times daily but now i am keeping always charge connected.	1
15469	Thank	0
15470	It was mentioned that it access to only Bluetooth but actually it does access to location & Bluetooth, if you check in Settings (especially in Android). Govt is saying that we don't access to location then does it show in the Settings of your applications. Also, Bluetooth(BT) doesn't connect automatically to other compatible BT devices. It only happens if it's paired which is not happening in COVID-19 safe app, then how on planet earth they are doing profiling. It sounds very fishy.	1

15481	Excellent App	0
15482	I was one of the people who download stop covid, but didn't keep it on my phone because my phone couldn't support the Bluetooth low energy mode. So seeing there was a new app, I download it too, but my phone is still not compatible with this app. However it should be a problem to work on in the future, because I think I'm not the only one who has a phone not compatible. But of I've seen, it's quite a good app tho, still better than stop covid.	1
15483	I thought this App was supposed to tell you if people around you or close to you had symptoms, it doesn't. It gives the exact same information you can find on RTE news this app is utterly useless and a waste of tax payers money. Uninstalled.	0

15489	Yesterday night it was fine and there was no problem in the app but today when i wanted to go out so i just opened ehteraz app at that time its not showing my name and my barcode	1
15490	I support the moi effort to contain the virus but this app is a big mistake. Instead of forcing everyone to download a badly designed app and threaten people with hefty penalty, moi should have tested the app multiple times and get feedback before mandating it prematurely. It slows the phone dramatically and drains battery so quickly. If one can't have the phone active whats the point of this app? I cant pause the app once i get home so it keeps draining battery. No need for access to photos.	0
15491	Did not receive any OTP during verification	1
15492	Gave 1 star due to horrible tone deaf ad on tik tok and its feeble attempt to reach anyone. Its Like a bung of 60 year old marketing execs watched a rerun of saved by the bell and they had the students watching a safety video that was trying to be cool and they took that premise to get younger people to download the app.	1
15493	The notifikasi changed. Even the yesterday notif changed too. Yesterday i got notif at red zone and now after i update and force close it manualy they magically change to zona aman. All the notif. How can i trust this app if there is major bug in the release version?	1
15494	Predictably infuriating. Won't accept mobile number, can't register.	1
15495	Its become very confused and now will not run unless my GPS is turned on. I am not happy about this. My phone will no longer connect to car bluetooth. This is a new problem not seen by me before. With all these issues i will be unistalling until the App works better.	1
15496	Suggest the message You're Okay box move to below the common use box Share this app and Safe Entry. Because currently every time check-in you need to scroll down to access the Safe Entry to scan the 2D barcode which is very inconvenient especially moving shop to shop in shopping mall.	1
15497	Good application	0
15498	The phone number detection cannot handle wifi-calling. Turn off your wifi, go outside or turn off wifi calling. Which is all a pretty poor start, really. Every single other app from banking to two factor authentication seems to manage this...	1

15508	HI, my NRIC cant enter keep saying vaildation failed check all fields i tried alot of times but keep saying pls check the NRIC	1
15509	Doesn't work on my Huawei mate 20. Every time I open the app, the phone detects the battery drain and then shuts the app down for me to save my battery. So unless I manually reopen the app every 5-10 minutes, it's never on. So is absolutely useless.	1

15525	The app has been working well until today when it started eating up battery. The same thing happened to my wife's phone. My is a Samsung A40 while her's is a Samsung A5. We had to uninstall it to get the phone to charge. I won't install it until this is sorted.	1

15534	Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).	0
15535	Hi, i'm foreigner who marriaged with Singaporean this march, i just have passport and my LTVP is not yet approved and always got rejected maybe more than 5times, So when i sign up in trace together using passport, the check-in button doesn't show up, there is just share app button. So this app just for who have nric, ltvp, pr, or workpass right? Not for foreigner, i just wanna make sure., anw for this time i always use barcode scan, wanna try tracetogether, but Seems like it doesnt support my id	1
15536	Now that's its fixed no issue with phone anymore ????	1
15537	Aside from the battery drain bump due to Google messing up the play services component, seems to be relative straight forward to use. Would be nice if the national picture and overall number stats provided last 7 day and 14 day versions as the total numbers aren't particularly useful at this stage. Maybe even provide per 100k numbers?	1
15538	Don't trust this guys it's just a joke	1
15539	this perfect app during the day however it was very huge features even some android phone doesn't work i have simple samsung phone when i did download this app my phone is very hot and doesn't support. it's really use full whoever my phone doesn't support. this not only my problem huge number of people having this problem. thanks for huge help and support qatar government and qatar MOI you did really great job regarding the coivd19 pandemic i hope this circumstances reduce very soon. thanks qatar government and huge support.	0

15546	I have tried to do the right thing but having to have location on whenever I leave the house is causing problems with other apps and I'm so fed up with changing location permissions only to have them mysteriously change themselves back every time I restart my phone.

15585	I keep getting an error message stating Tracker will not work unless Google Play services is updated. I am unable to update this and try as I might, I cannot enable the tracker. I uploaded Carroer Services by Google (same icon as GP services) but still no luck. So the app is useless to me.	1
15586	Good app	0
15587	If u care for you and those around u download this app..location and Bluetooth encounters are keep private and won't be shared, so keep calm and all data will be deleted after 14days.. small thing to do but big thing to keep everyone safe	0
15588	Does exactly what it states. No issues with listening to music over Bluetooth. I turn the Bluetooth off when home to save on battery, only turn on when outside. Mostly staying Home anyway, so all good battery wise. Would have liked to access to some statistics on how many contacts it picked up, per days, over the rolling 21 days.	1

15598	I had to uninstall the app as my battery was draining monstrously fast (had to completely recharge my phone 3 times in 24 hours). Will install back once I know this problem has been sorted as it is unfeasable to not have a reliable battery when out and about.	1
15599	OTP not working!	1
15600	Great idea. But it interferes with my earphones and car system. So I use it only when I don't use bluetooth for anything else and when I remember to a enable bluetooth in covid safe app.	0
15601	Good	0
15602	Good but it keeps lagging my bluetooth ear buds. Its very very very annoying. So much so as I'm so very tempted to either uninstall or else i have to keep pausing the app (making the app redundant) every time when I'm connected to my ear buds.	1
15603	good movement by the government, but please try to do something abt the battery consumption. I don't mind if u add an option that let's me indicate I'm home, then scans only half hourly and then actively if I have movement more than 50meters, and option to indicate im out of the house etc	1
15604	Agree with other reviews. Battery drain started on 8th August is making my phone unusable. Will have to uninstall app which is a pity, as I think its a great idea.	1

15652	Excellent app, puts privacy first and well-designed. A powerful tool to anonymously assist with covid track and trace efforts on the island of Ireland, it alerts you where possible if your phone has been detected to have been close to someone else with the app who has reported symptoms. All done in a de-centralised way in which you retain control of your data, via anonymous keys, and choose what to share if anything. Easy to use and understand interface. And open source.

15690	Installed - "GPS must be always on" - deleted it. Claiming privacy first, but requiring GPS to be on to work in combination with Internet access is not privacy. Big Brother / Google - type of privacy is a no go. Btw, for BLE device scan you could have used: "Bluetooth.Adapter.getDefaultAdapter().startDiscovery()" to avoid need for GPS, but you didn't, so it's a conscious choice to violate privacy principles.	1

15701	Dropping to 4 as serious battery drain on version 1.0.1.44 recently. May be related to July 2020 Android 9 update which installed last week. Simple, streamlined and effective. I hope to never get the alert though.	1
15702	its ok hardly speaks truth and eventually started crashing totally, doesnt even start.	1
15703	This app is draining battery so fast keeps forcing Bluetooth on.	1
15704	This is not good. I walked out of my flat, took an empty lift and walk passed 2 people to go to the bus stop and it shows 127 exchanges. There is a man and a woman who just came and are sitting 2 meters away. Update 9th July Thank you very much for your prompt response. I get what you mean. It's still scary but I appreciate the effort and trust that I am safe with your reassurance. Am re-rating to more stars.	0
15705	Simple to use.. Clear information	0
15706	Ate my battery yesterday and phone heating up. Was fine for last few weeks but I had to uninstall. I would like to keep this app as it is important. Hopefully fixed soon. Reinstalled and no problems for the last week. Hopefully battery issue fixed.	1
15707	Love the idea, completely support the need for it but it killed my battery. Uninstalled it but sort of feel obliged to have it so trying again. Not expecting any differences this time round	0

15713	Despite having my Bluetooth on constantly, the app is telling me tracing is not active. There is clearly a bug in the app that needs fixed.	1
15714	Update 10 Jun '20: Updated the app and experiencing no crashes so far. Posted 07 Jun '20: I re-installed the app to access the option to register with Visa, but the app won't open. I get a system error message saying 'Ehteraz keeps stopping'. I've sent feedback on the issue. Please fix asap.	0
15715	Battery drains really quickly. I have read that this is being rectified? When? If not soon, I will have to delete, which I don't really want to do.	1

15720	Why this app required our storage and call log permission? Location information is ok, but why our personal data?	1
15721	Good useful information	0
15722	Very happy to have this installed. For me the one drawback is the icon in the notification bar at the top of the screen, which is always there to indicate the app is running. It is a small green square. When I get a new WhatsApp message notification, it is also a small green square - and the same also for wechat messages. A different coloured icon would be good!	0

15733	Runs fine for me. I keep bluetooth off for battery savings while at home but turn it on when I go out for any reason. It reminds me to do that all the time, which is probably wise of it.	0

15783	It's a good app. But this is my second time reinstalling it. And the reason why I uninstalled the first time was because of its battery consumption. My phone went from 100 to 10% within 4 hrs.. Is there anyway that the app can be more energy efficient? By the way, I'm using an old phone. Samsung S9. Imagine people using the older phone. Their phone will be drained even faster. I strongly believe this is one of the main reasons why the take-up rate by public is so low.	1
15784	Good	0
15785	better to be safe then sorry	0
15786	Great app. Can't understand so much feedback about inability to switch the language.. But some stats about number of devices, located nearby within a period of time would be helpful to be sure, that app really works and is not blocked by OS settings some how (battery optimization settings, for example).	0
15787	After the 21st September 2020 update, the battery drain on my phone is crazy. Used to take under 3% of my battery to over 60% of my battery now	1
15788	Nice app	0
15789	Slows down my other apps.	1
15790	The app closes by itself even when I am on bluetooth. Ideally, the app should turn on the moment bluetooth comes on and it shouldn't act like an app but rather in the background. I have to use the app and it gets annoying to deal with the constant turn off.	1
15791	It wont send me the pin.	1

I did it many time and yet cannot go through as all my details are correct. Another thing is even when I put my OTP correctly it says it is wrong.This app has some issues they need to rectify soon. Really annoying. I am uninstalling it.	1

15816	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
15817	Good app	0
15818	Took days before I actually got it downloaded, I don't know whether from high internet volume or multiple downloads happening causing slow traffic	1
15819	Yo why does the app require use of Bluetooth??? It interferes with the signal of my other Bluetooth devices and causes them to keep cutting out. Can't you guys like i dunno, make it more user friendly if the whole of SG needs to use this app?	1

I will keep getting notification from my Galaxy Watch that it has disconnect from my Oneplus 7T. Wireless earphone will also disconnect constantly. I hope the Bluetooth for the app can be fixed and co-exist with my other devices.	1

15831	Couldn’t log in so reset password using Forgot Password option. Entered code and successfully created new password. App didn’t let me log in with new password so app becomes useless.\nUpdate: Received advice from developers to delete app and reinstall and this fixed the issue.	1
15832	App is good and now, with the inclusion of the barcode scan inside, however, some malls are not accepting this barcode and insist on a physical IC or QR safe entry scan, example Northpoint. It used to accept this barcode scan using this app but now, cannot already. If this mall and others do not accept, then what is the point of adding? \ud83d\ude2d	1
15833	Huge battery drain, my battery usually lasts for a day and after I opened the app it lasted tops 3 hours. The phone was also lagging a lot. Unusable if it's like that.	1
15834	App dont seem to work. I was sent the pin to key in but kept prompting me invalid pin. I uninstall and reinstall still same problem.	1
15835	I registered with staysafe.ph website before this app was launched. Why there is no option to login with facebook sa app.?	1
15836	I can't log in . It shows exceeded activation. I uinstalled and reinstalled it still no change	1
15837	Violation of people privacy, also they were hacked mid May.	1
15838	I don’t understand how this app can be effective. If one is COVID-19 positive:\n\nA.  How many people who are Covid positive have smart phones/know about or have the app?\nB.  If they are Covid positive, presumably in quarantine, how could I be exposed to the virus because of them?\nC.  How stupid would they have to be to report their condition to the app and then go out to expose others who may have the app??!!	1

15911	The concept is a good idea in theory. I only turn my wifi on when I leave home so I have not experienced any battery issues with my Galaxy S10 5G device. I don't believe any state or territory has been able to read any data being produced by this app yet, therefore it's difficult to know if the app is actually working?	0

15954	After the Update the app crashing after opening again and again.. Fix this	1
15955	i get this was done in a hurry but SOME testing should have been done before release, asside from battery drain it goes into a Bluetooth pairing fit every few minutes (audio clicks & stutters, looses bluetooth pairing) makes phone too annoying to use (uninstalling fixed it ... i wont reinstall)	1
15956	Showing error message while loading "Contact customer support"	1
15957	Great to find out this app is part of the Linux Foundation public health project, one of few that implement GAEN. Although it does not seem to be the best engineered and truly useful app for the purpose, the UI is good and provides useful stats. Lately, It started draining my phone (Samsung S7) battery at about 1% per min when Bluetooth was kept off at night (keeps polling for BT?) and hogs otherwise, though may not be the case on all phones. IMO use of GPS data along BT might have been useful, BT alone does not seem to be of much use, perhaps it is more of the available phone device platforms that restrict potential capabilities of this app otherwise I am sure the Developers would have done an even excellent job.	1
15958	Good	0
15959	I thought it was supposed to be confidential but your profile and name is published, you must leave bluetooth on permanently? And people from the 6 counties not included ? Someone hasn't done their homework. This will lessen the uptake , will they read these comments?.	1

15964	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
15965	The app stopped working multiple times and I can't seem to get it working again, don't know what causes it, just right when I needed it the most/when it notified me of a "yellow zone". - Tried to restart my phone and it still won't work - Tried to update the app to the latest version with similiar results - Tried to reinstall the app and yet it still won't work. This app has lots of potential to help "contact tracing" and therefore, limit the spread of COVID-19. But it needs stability	1
15966	Ok but since installation my phone is turning to airplane mode on its own, frequently	1
15967	I too had the app constantly switch off. SOLUTION: i believe the following two things can help this solution (seems to have helped me through the last day): 1. Settings - Location -... - Scanning - disable Bluetooth Scanning. I believe this interrupts the covidsafe app. 2. Settings - Developer Options (google this to find out how to enable) - enable Bluetooth HCI Snoop Log. Having reported issue and possible solution through the app, why I haven't heard back from Covidsafe app team.	1

15975	Just open the app and you literally dont have to do anything else. So why are people complaining I dont get it. The information you need regarding how the app works are all online and easy to find. If your battery is draining fast, I suggest a change in phone cause it doesnt affect mine, and mine isnt even the good phones either.	0
15976	The idea is Nice, people need to register so that it will be useful.	1

15979	Everyone should have this app.	0
15980	Worst app ever built, poor battery usage, poor coding. Novel idea but made the worst way possible. My phone battery will not even last a few hours with it running, where it can nornally last a day without. What is the point of a dead phone in this case? I hope the developer will never make another app in his or her lifetime.	1
15981	I stayed at home the whole day but can still get 95 exchanges with other trace users!? Even if my family is at home, the number should not be this high. Is the bluetooth range so wide that perhaps it can detect my neighbour's?	1

16002	I don't understand the use of this app, when i came in contact with a covid +ve person, the app alerts after 5-10 days, fayeda kya hai is app ka bhai, jab ye immediately alert nahi kar sakta?	1
16003	It's important people use it. It's safe and works good. You have all the current key info about the Covid at hand. Also you are informed about next steps as soon as possible if there was a risk you got infected. So you can immediately stop spreading virus further, doing your part saving lives, health and easing the weight put on med staff. It's a huge help with minimum effort. It does have a meaning. Any extra time we help to gain for the continuing intense worldwide research is worth a lot.	0
16004	Asks for GPS location. I uninstalled this app because it kept asking me to enable Google location services, therefore accessing my GPS location. This is in stark contrast to what was claimed.	1

16024	Why does app needs access to my storage and phone? And no it's nothing to do with security of my device... Why would I give u full access to my fone... It's against every privacy policy... Giving access to location is still somewhat acceptable but why storage?	1

16045	I'm on the latest version of the app which is using on average over 50% of my daily battery consumption, my Samsung S20 plus constantly feels warm and I've to charge the phone twice a day to keep up.	1
16046	Simple so far. Language options missing, in addition to '"flexibly exposed status", which may vary unknowingly	0
16047	Drains out phone battery quickly. Can improvement be made to address this?	1

Sing is my 2nd home, claim to be global hub, so very weird way to deter foreigner with no IC, making it more difficult to do the right thing. When tracetogether becomes the only mandatory way, I'm told I should show my passport instead. Back to stone age. Speechless!	1

16105	I'm sad. I saw that my friend using iPhone has a widget, but we don't have it on android phones. Also, the splash screen which displays for a few seconds each time we open the app makes starting the app and use the features longer than it could be. No wonder, there's always people stuck at the barcode waiting for the app to load.	1

16118	Good initiative to keep everyone safe. But two complaints since downloading: 1) Drains battery exponentially and 2) Disconnects my headphones. Both of which a huge nuisance.

16129	It is a good initiative by government how ever, this app forces users to allow the app access to media files such as photos etc in your phone which is a huge invasion of privacy that is difficult to accept. Please correct this because this has nothing to do with tracking corona.	1

16153	App interrupt with Bluetooth of my phone to connect with other devices. Kindly do not ask for phone brand and firmware. As I have read in the comments a lot of people are having the same issue. This is likely due to the app constant scanning or connecting to other Bluetooth devices that is causing this? Thus interrupting the devices that the phone is suppose to connect. Which are the Bluetooth devices owned by the phone owner. Purpose solution: scan is enough, there is no need to connect.	1
16154	Why would you need to pin point my location? Take the location perm off and i'll be happy to run it.	1
16155	App works well, except after last update its starting to have a lot of background battery usage, which is far from ideal on a tracking app, some optimization would be good to see regarding that. Update: google play services using 111% and covid tracker 40% battery, phone temp was super high, battery drainage was high, uninstalled and temp and battery drain are gone, please solve this issue fast so I can reinstall this app since it is a critical app nowadays.	1
16156	this is garbage. there is absolutely no reason to use location for what this thing does. bluetooth is an acceptable privacy breach for the cause, but this is beyond anything reasonable. also, if it's as safe as you claim - publish the sources for what you actually deploy, so we can peer review them. just like us, you have nothing to hide. right?	1

16167	Lots of figures but no guidance about where to avoid to minimise exposure. I am over 70 and I complete it every day but feel it is wasting amazing technology. LEA figures are an improvement but still too broad. I go to mainly supermarkets in Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords but theres no guidance on which is lowest risk for me. I can't go to pubs so it is only supermarkets and the app is no help.	1

16185	Loaded and operates without any hassles. Loves chewing through the battery though...	1
16186	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0

It doesnt start up with the phone. I need to re-start it everytime i go anywhere. Its a pain to keep using and i will be suprised if they get any useful data from it. Its a rush job and it shows and im giving up on it for now. Maybe some updates in the future will fix it for more devices.	1

16213	Doesn't alert you to infected cases in your area. Drains battery pretty fast due to Bluetooth connection. Not sure how this app is supposed to work as there's not much info coming from it. Also don't think personal data will be a concern for public health measures if it means improvement for the app.	1
16214	Works as it should. Install says to turn off battery optimisation and location on for this app... so do it; stop being a superstitious idiot and knowall, no excuses.	1

Hope the software updates can eventually resolve this.	1

16305	Good initiative to aid contact tracing. However, bluetooth audio is disrupted and music playback will be interrupted every 10-15 seconds which is irritating. This is especially relevant in an office setting where users will be on Bluetooth earphones and where tracing is important. Please look into the issue if its resolvable. Battery drain is manageable on a Samsung Note 8.	1

16336	This is important and if you are hesitating, know that it isn't tracking your movements... Also that it is going to give you an early warning if you've been in contact with an infected person so you can isolate and get tested and keep your family and community safe.	1

16461	Doesn't work, no safe entry button on main screen, my phone is Xiaomi redmi note 9s, android 10. After brief email exchange with support, turns out app doesn't work with passport no. Sing is my 2nd home, claim to be global hub, so very weird way to deter foreigner with no IC, making it more difficult to do the right thing. When tracetogether becomes the only mandatory way, I'm told I should show my passport instead. Back to stone age. Speechless!	1

16467	refuses to send the pin. have tried with and without preceding zero, turned off wifi, uninstalled/reinstalled. android 9, nokia. now the real question: how many registrations have been successful compared to the number of downloads (not including reinstalls)? it will eventually need an app notification reminder to register for all the unregistered devices once the bugs have been fixed.	1
16468	Not opening	1
16469	Very high battery usage from this app over the past number of days. 8% an hour of battery been used by the app. I do turn bluetooth off when I am at home and turn it on again when heading out. But I certainly dont want to be charging my phone 2-3 times a day! Developers can you look into this? As if it continues I will have to uninstall and I'm sure I'm not the only one and more people will follow suit.	1

All the update, have make this application much better, compared when it was first launched. This is the only app I use for checking in or out. To the developer team, keep up the good work and keep improving. Thanks.	0

16518	Absolutely The worst app out there. 50% of battery used daily by this app, that half of the time I can use my phone, i marked the app to go to deep sleep but it override my manual input in android and move itself to the list never put on sleep, it need GPS and Bluetooth all time in order to work which is ridiculous it is also doesn't respect your privacy	1
16519	Hi there, I'm using Samsung Note 10plus, android version 10. The issue I'm facing is it doesn't allow me to add other family members into my account. The tracetogether version for Android is 2.3.11 while the version in IOS is 2.4 which allows user to add other family members to their account. Possible to rectify the issue for Android users. By the way, I've sent an email too. Thanks	1
16520	Before has problem I gave 5star, but now I give 3star. After update, shows notification: to close this app. Then I can not open this app. Please fix it.	1
16521	Singapore, I love you. Thank you!	0
16522	Appears to work good. I'm using Samsung a10. But I think a GPS tracking /tracing system along side Bluetooth would be more precise. ???? Stay safe all ?? ?? ??	0
16523	Glitchy	1
16524	Updated the rating since the language issue was fixed to include English. App is simple and works well. Would be great to include some sort of location check in so we can help pin point places where outbreaks occur.	0
16525	I have my updated number as well in eid.but still showing some other number which is not mine...didnt get the covid test result.....always looking for location...if u just want to force as u r asking to do.then why giving option to choose.meaning less.	1
16526	This app stopped me from receiving text messages from international numbers. Not good considering I'm in Aus and my parents and family are in the UK. I've deleted the app and now have contact with my family.	1
16527	What started out well has gone in the wrong direction. Can't even register now - keeps saying wrong OTP. Tedious to set up and intrusive, asks for IC date of issue (for what? Not necessary until I've been exposed.) On top of all this I ask myself why I even bother, when this app won't work properly on my friends' iPhones and they've all refused to use it. To Govt and GovTech... can you PLEASE just make use of the Apple/Google COVID-19 framework which is a much more efficient solution.	1
16528	It needs improvements! Make it fresh look!	1
16529	Devs, I get that this app is purely functional for tracing purposes. If you can add some features that will appeal to the user your download rate will sky rocket. I hope you consider this.	1

16542	very poor.....app not working since last update	1
16543	I had to install it on the insistence by airport security. I uninstalled it at the earliest I could. Recently even judges are asking convicts on bail to install this app. I don't buy the justification from the app developers that the app needs to be used for the good of my family. Let me freely choose, if you still agree to the concept of free will of a law abiding citizen. Don't use your CISF muscle power to get me install it and use it.	1
16544	Simple and easy to use. Could do with daily notifications to remind you to check-in. And would be useful with more historical data to look at specific case numbers per day.	0
16545	Why do we even need this app? What does the qatar government thinking? They need strickly make lockdown to this country for more safety. And even i can't register to this app it says "registration error" wth is going on with this country? Why do we have to pay for fine for not registering to this app.	1

16553	After giving all the permissions, I click on a button to activate the app, it tells me I have to input a code for verification and then it hangs there for a minute before kicking me back to the main menu. In its current state, this app is useless.	1

16556	App will not send the pin to my mobile number, cannot reactivate the app on my iPhone that up until now, has not had any problems. Trying to do the right thing however when the app server appears to be faulting it is getting more and more difficult to maintain the app use that is constantly draining my phone battery. Please URGENTLY resolve the app issue!! Note - not a user error, I have wifi off, have not had issues up until today with using the app.	1

16562	Hey guys, there must be something wrong with the app in the background, my phone keeps deactivating the app and I have a warning that it's not active, but when I go in the app it says everything is working fine. Then 5 mins later (more or less) it's goes offline again. Then the phone is happy. Then again later on it's all turned off. I got no idea what is going on here	1
16563	How does contacting tracing work when there is no information sharing from health agency? This app works on the assumption that when someone has Covid-19 positive result, they would be kind enough to input their result.  If you putting all your effort into each individual using this app to input their result, this app will fail. The government should had allowed information sharing. This app is a waste of resource.	1

However, the nurse who tested me told me that the code provided by the app was useless and that I would have to contact my doctor to find out what the results of the test were. I hope this system will improve as it discourages people from getting tested.	1

16608	After multiple media sources had said these track and trace apps are being shared with the police I uninstalled. My understanding was that my details would be encrypted and I was basically known as a number/key and my details WOULD NOT be shared with ANYONE. I guess its just another way for the government to spy on you and fine you. NO THANKS.	1
16609	Not working for me. I have been trying to register both from phone number and facebook but i only keep getting errors. I have been receiving OTP but never redirected me to the next page, instead, it only says there has been an error.	1

If you seriously think this is an affront to your civil liberties, well you better throw away your smart phone, pull out your phone line and live off-grid.

16741	It caused my Bluetooth headphones to stop working correctly. When the Covid app was running, anything playing on the headphones would cut out every 10 seconds or so.

16755	Can not download!	1
16756	A great concept but it needs all of us to use it to help keep us all safe. Note oppo users will need to lock the app so the phone doesn't close it down. To do that, start the app, tap the square menu thing at the bottom of your phone, swipe the app down (you should then see a padlock at the top left of the app screen).	0
16757	Why it will not support mi 10 phone	1
16758	Ei tööta huawei telefonis. Nõuab Google play uuemat versiooni. Paraku tehnilistel põhjustel ei saa ma seda uuendada kuna siis kaotaksin ka selle vähese ligipääsu Google teenustele mis uue huawei omanikul on. Võibolla on võimalik teha sellest versioon huawei store'i või hoida vähem sõltuvad ühe konotstiumi teenustest. Teine tärn selle eest, et teistel on sellest apist abi. Parimat. MK	1
16759	There is an option 'pause tracetogether', which lock your phone to force you to click resume, really funny.	1

16846	Sorry I had originally gave 5 but I've had to delete this App from my phone as it was draining phone and overheating it. It's a shame as I've had it installed since App became available. My phone is only new Samsung Galaxy A20e. Please fix this issue so I can reinstall it Since fix all seems to be back to normal ??	1

16848	Only good if you don't use Bluetooth headphones. Every 30 seconds interrupts audio playback, distorting it. Had to force stop the app while using Bluetooth devices.	1

16852	In the last few days my phone has started to freeze up and received notifications relating to high CPU, also had severe battery drain (56% to 0% in space of 2hours - during which phone was not even being used). When checking further, both the Play Services and Covid Tracker app were eating memory. Issue doesnt seem be directly attributed to Covid app, but it relies heavily on Play Services which is the culprit (last update). Clearing the Services cache does help at least!	1

Can get the info from Google? Also, if SafeEntry is gong to be mandatory, why there is no SafeEntry app? And, it also implying this app doesn't serve the purpose.	0

16876	Great initiative from the government! Set up is a breeze. I feel this app drains my phone battery but I don't mind, because we are all doing our part to fight COVID-19. With so many new cases daily, it requires a huge amount of resources to do contact tracing. With this app, we can all help to make the process more efficient. Everyone, let's band together and download this app! #SGUnited	0

16883	No issues with blutooth. I suggest people who are struggling with that in the car, turn the radio ABC news on instead of spotify, to keep up with yhe news? Then your phone is free for calls. And get an extra charger for work and car, to deal with the battery drain. These are tough times. Now IS the time to deviate from our comfort zone.	1

16922	I can't get past the phone number stage. Keeps telling me my phone number is invalid. I have had the same number for donkeys years. I even tried without the zero. Unless someone can help me this app is useless to me.	1
16923	Excellent application. In current situation This is helpful to recognise others about their Corona Status. This pandemic is a great headache for every country. We don't know how can we return back to our normal life. So We will consider this application as a part of our normal life	0
16924	SafeEntry from long press TraceTogether icon should remember any previous check in and prompt out check out screen, instead of showing scan QR code for new check in. This occurred when closing app (kill task) after check in.	1

16928	App started well. But after some time I noticed a lot of un-charactistic that were not usual. In coming call - the screen goes black. Warnings of battery failure. High battery usage. Moving through apps was slower than normal.Some apps would not open or freeze on the screen. Found bluetooth connections with other devices also impossible, had to restart phone every time to fix it. Once deleted most if not all functional operation has returned on first day. Not happy needs work here to re-instal	1
16929	battery empty very fast	1
16930	Stops at the stage when it is supposed to send me an OTP.	1
16931	App does not start after turning phone off for several hours. I have to go into the app to restart it. I don't always remember to do it.	1
16932	It keeps interfering with any additional bluetooth device that I connect to when running this app. For example, if I connect to a bluetooth speaker or to my car for hands-free and maps, it drops me out every 15min or so, losing connection and having to re-start everything manually again. It will suddenly cut out any calls, music or maps directions. Would be great if this was fixed so we can keep running it in the background without interruptions.	1

16936	Good	0
16937	I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.	0
16938	So many bugs and errors in it..	1
16939	The reason I rate this app a 1 * is that it's completely disconnected from my experience with the real world!! When you go to do your grocery shopping you want to be in and out as fast as possible to ensure minimizing social interactions. This app is useless. What it needs urgently is the ability to scan the QR code so that we can get in and out of stores. The stores are not equipped to scan the provided bar code and as a result they don't even offer check out. => Pointless app.	1

16948	All good but enough already with the motivational and self-aggrandising messages it continuously and continuously sends out. I had to turn notifications off to shut the thing up. That probably means I won\u2019t get a notification if I come close to a risky patient. Doh!	1

16951	V easy to use. Fast. Love the Family n FAV places features. Well done. Request to dev team: Please consider to add Widget feature for quick access to QR scan n press/hold drop down list to FAV n Family options on Widget. Update: I saw that widget feature has been added. The widget icon on my home screen now directs me to the app QR code scanner directly on one click. Makes it so much easier to use. Thanks!	0

16970	Seems pretty good. Does consume battery. I initially had issues because installing on a phone set with English as the language caused the activation to fail. It seems that issue was fixed quickly (a day or two) and now it works fine. Glad to have this now I'm going back out occasionally.	1

16990	Still waiting for the one time code...15 minutes has passed.	1
16991	We are unable to register for it because of ID Expare... Please Make tha option....	1
16992	Good	0
16993	On my stock Pixel 2 XL, I've attempted to register using networks and multiple installations of the app and multiple phone number formats (as the app's help site advises), all multiple times per day since launch, and, instead of sending me an activation code, I'm told to try again later. Over and over again. After what must be well over one hundred attempts to register, it's time to uninstall.	1
16994	Useful app for combat corona virus in Qatar	0

16996	Very very very Bad app because when update so working stop	1
16997	DO NOT INSTALL, NOT SAFE This is BAD: it actually requires you to have gps on, this is a breach of privacy It is sadly not avoidable because of how Bluetooth works but I really expected more from a government funded project	1
16998	Easy to install, vital to help tracing and with little security risk imho.	0
16999	I am not able to check in as whenever i am clicking on the check in link it's disappearing automatically and there is no way or place in the app to report any technical issue. I am getting automated calls that i have not checking in but no one is picking the call even on 151 to resolve this issue. Sonu Mewada	1
17000	No English version. And can't take screenshots also due to dev policy so I can't import screenshots to google translate in order to at least use the app and translate to understand something.	1

17002	Very poor	1
17003	Non-intrusive and securing for the user! I fully approve!	0
17004	Good app	0
17005	Good , but not best	0
17006	I think it's great to integrate the safe entry to the app. However, as a SAF regular, I'm unable to input My NRIC to the system due to my IC being a 11B, resulting in me being stuck at the front page. Reason? I am not sure of the date of issue of my original Pink NRIC which I've surrendered years ago	0
17007	Keep saying that it's the incorrect QR code	1
17008	Unable to register, getting temporary unavailable error	1
17009	To protect myself I follow this application	0
17010	When i open ehteraz every time asking registration now show me Exceeded numbers of activation please contact 109. Please clear this issue.	1
17011	great app	0
17012	App worked perfectly before. Now I can't use it. It keeps notifying me that my device has rooted which is totally wrong since I am using Samsung's original latest android update !!!	1
17013	After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. The restoration of normal service was a pain in the ass & only possible by re registration on my chosen chemist's website. It seems to have begun, though its not confirmed. As an interim, prescriptions will be delivered to a chemist shop nearer my home. Why mess about like this!?? Is the app or NHS at fault?	1

17019	Spying app just to collect information, no real use, not showing people with Covid around me - useless	1
17020	Great way to keep track of where I go but the Bluetooth drained so much battery I ended up disabling it again	0
17021	Had the app since mid July and it suddenly started draining the battery of my S20 yesterday. This seems to be happening to a lot of people all of a sudden. Needs to be fixed or everyone is going to remove the app from their phones	1

17032	App stops very frequently. Even after restarting as well.	1
17033	Very bad application take ages just to upload data even with 5G	1
17034	29 Dec. Why does the app keep prompting me to turn my Bluetooth on when it already is?	1
17035	The TraceTogether app drains my battery very quickly since the time I have downloaded it and turned on my Bluetooth for it. So I cannot really use my phone much because of the fast battery draining. So I don't understand the reason why I must download the app name hence I gave it no star.	1
17036	Good	0
17037	Tried several times, the verification pin code doesn't come to my phone so I cant proceed further.. And yes the number given is correct.	1

17046	After I have installed this app to my hand phone and going to register with my handphone no, it came out the statement that my hp with the internet connection issue ! I have been many time and use many type of internet connection...who can tell me how to solve this problem? Samsung Galaxy G7-Primer, my hp model.	1

17053	I have changed my phone. And i am trying to install this app again in my new device. But it\u2019s not working. It Doesn\u2019t register. This is so frustrating.	1
17054	I'm using an android and I can't seem to validate my nric although I keyed it correctly. Is there anyone facing this issue, and it would be great if they could provide some 'helplines' in the app that we can contact?	1
17055	Very bad app no good information and not take care	1
17056	Isn't useful, drains a lot of battery power.... Please fix	1
17057	This app never checks in the background. You need to open it yourself regularly to get notified (look in Google settings to see the history of checks, you can see that it's not checking). ?????????????????????????????????????????	1
17058	The app is consuming a huge chunk of battery usage around 25-35% which drains the battery really fast. What's worst is that despite having the app turned on, it's not giving out any notification of nearby Covid-19 patients on my Samsung S9+. Just yesterday my aunt's Note 5 stopped working due to battery drainage by this app. You'll have to do something about this app and make it more stable and not cause devices to corrupt.	1
17059	Not good at all, just waste of time. Accessing my private stuff is makes feel like I'm the app	1
17060	It is bad for my phone battery , it drains it from time to time, not happy with it .	1
17061	It looks like from the 8th of August people are reporting phones overheating and batteries draining. This is happening to everyone in my household and the covid application is causing the problem. This is extremely serious because people will just uninstall the app if it's killing their batteries. Developers please take note and fix this urgently.	1

17069	Bad	1
17070	Battery life is terrible with this app	1
17071	Easy to forget to check in. I'd suggest a notification to remind user to check in each day if they haven't already.	0
17072	I did not uninstall the app The Battery issues appear to have been resolved.	1
17073	This software is not compatible with Android 10. Fix the bugs. Please.	1
17074	Was working fine till yesterday when I went to a supermarket .when I showed the security my app it had a large question mark where the green QR should be . I was told to uninstall the app then reinstall which I did , yet question mark did not go away and till today is still there.tried calling the helpline at least 5 times yet no response. I have a S9 so I really dont think the phone is the problem	1
17075	Not able to access the app...please tell us how to go about. I need to get the result urgently.	1
17076	Improvement suggestion. If the number rate per 100,000 is now the new criteria per county, it would be great to also get that in there on the county breakdown.	1

17083	Drain off battery fast for samsung note model	1
17084	Good but it keeps lagging my bluetooth ear buds. Its very very very annoying. So much so as I'm so very tempted to either uninstall or else i have to keep pausing the app (making the app redundant) every time when I'm connected to my ear buds.	1
17085	Remarkably easy to use.	0

17088	Show the government confirmed cases gps location . Atleast we can break the chain of spread that way! We should also be given information of where was the confirmed case last been. That is the only way we can be cautious. Better safe than sorry! I have many confirmed cases in my area but its showing none	1
17089	After update it can't run at my Huawei mate 30 pro. Had try to uninstall & reinstall, it still can't work. Does it mean Huawei w/o Google are not welcome to use. (stuck at OTP). Everything is fine till OTP.	1

17095	Horrendous battery performance. For a "mandatory" app you'd think they would do a better job	1
17096	There is no mentionable features. App just redirect website. One junior developer, max 16 hours need to be required to develop such type of app!	1
17097	The app is good from the use I had of it. Unfortunately I had to delete the app as it was completely draining my battery (OnePlus 7Tpro) within a few hours of full charge. It would normally last more than a day per charge. My wife experienced the same issue (OnePlus 6T).	1
17098	I have y9s but ehteraz not working	1
17099	I didn't receive the OTP it said "internal server error" this app is trash too much bug in the app it doesn't ready to release please delete it	1

17101	This app is killing my battery over the last 24 to 28 hours. Is there a fix on the way. The app is hardly viable if I can't keep my phone on me because it has to charge every 3 hours	1

17108	First of all thank you so much eGovernment for such a beneficial app which made us less worried and less nervous and more conscious !! It is as important to us as it is to the government where we can knw if we happened to encounter someone infected or not which makes us comfortably go to work and market for important grocery and even for self and family care check??????	0
17109	Operates ok but not uncommon, to stop working. All settings correct on Note10+ but constantly getting warning that app has stopped working.	1
17110	Very good	0
17111	Great idea, but couldn't sign up. I get an error message when I enter my phone number (Says: not a valid Singapore number). I see in the comments there are many people in my boat . No option within the app to report the problem. Please fix, I'd love to use it!	1
17112	Everything is working f\u00edne	0
17113	Why my alhosn application not open when I press the alhosn application click after again back not open	1
17114	This app should have a QR code reader built in for venue check-ins. Then state governments could mandate it be used for all check-ins. That would get more people using it.	0

17130	This app interferes with my bluetooth earbuds. Lots of stuttering sounds and abrupt disconnections. I had to troubleshoot and realized that the earbuds worked fine after uninstalling the app - i guess there's no function to temporarily switch off the app. We use our handphone bluetooth for other purposes too. I hope this can be rectified and improvements needed.	1

17160	When I unlock my phone the app's icon in the notification area is a triangle with an exclamation mark in it then after about a second it changes to the shield with the Bluetooth symbol in it, this is suggesting to me that the app may not be running when my phone is locked.	1
17161	It is great we can access each county and wonderful to know if we are in contact with the virus	0

17191	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0

17200	A very nicely made, minimalist app, that only uses as much information as is required. Only requires the use of Bluetooth to keep track of other devices you've been in close contact with throughout your day, and notifies you if the user of one of those devices contracts symptoms.	0

17207	Looking into the logs, I notice that the app only checks the exposure when i open the app. Right now the latest exposure check was more than four days ago, either the logs are wrong or the app does not work properly.	1
17208	Good	0
17209	Why does this app asking for the permission to access media and photos?	1
17210	Note:Bluetooth tends to drain phone battery if used for long periods on top other apps Areas of improvement: perhaps the check in and check out function for safe entry can be incorporated so we can see existing check in locations and allow us to via app scan to check in. N remotely check out without needing to rescan	1
17211	Your Bluetooth function has drain my battery within a day. Very irritating, if it is not instruction by my management, i shall uninstall it.	1
17212	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0

17221	Since I have installed this app, my phone keeps getting disconnected from my cars hands free device. It is a bit annoying. I have to unpair my phone and cars hands free and again pair them up. An urgent fix is needed for this issue. Some of my friends and colleagues also are having the same problem.	1

17229	Facing the same issue as other users as well. Thought my wireless earbuds has started to be faulty but once I saw the reviews it was actually this app interrupting the bluetooth connection, making my music I am listening to stop for a split second sometimes. Hope something is being done to fix this if Singapore is pushing for more people to use TraceTogether. :)	1

17241	Not working properly	1
17242	Thanks for locking me out permanently just because i put the wrong nric issue date. It's not like i wanted to watch that movie or anything.	1
17243	The app does not provide Allow location all the time.. it only provides While using the app or Deny.. and both of these options crashes the app.. the call center didn't help and told me to wait for the new update!! When will it be released?? Please help!	1

17252	Not working	1
17253	ok so this app doesnt work if you use tpg as your mobile network bc tpg is not very good and like even though im using it ( bc free ) and tpg lies to their users so change your network and download this again but yes i cldnt get the otp bc of the " invalid " number thing	1
17254	Good App	0
17255	It does not accept my phone number, saying my phone number is invalid	1
17256	Good , thankyou	0
17257	Why this application wrong information show on screen I'd expire when I'd expired 2021 why	1
17258	Showing ? When I open etharaz app. I contact the technical support not getting proper feedback. I tried to clear up the data in app info. Then its working fine....	0
17259	Had to reset my phone and reinstall the app. Now when I try to open it after agreeing to the t's&c's I get "Error code: (1003). Please try again" .	1
17260	Very good ,â˜ºï¸�	0
17261	Good features but battery consumption went crazy, had to uninstall.	1
17262	Shows false Alarms : One of my colleague's got a false alarm of being 'Covid Positive / Red ðŸ”´ Status' and rest of the colleagues got the 'Orange / yellow statuses'. Eventually Arogya setu is mandatory at workplaces and Airports. Eventually we are not being allowed at workplace and the ones who had their journey planned had to unnecessarily suffer due to the false alarms by the Arogya setu app!	1
17263	I couldn't even receive my otp within the given time limit. Cannot proceed.	1
17264	Easy installation!	0
17265	This app causes my handphone to keep restarting. It wrote itself into memory and crashes my handphone!	1
17266	Very useful for this app\ud83d\ude0d tq sg	0
17267	On s20 ultra need to restart the app if your phone battery died on you by overuse as it doesn't start automatically when you run out of juice mostly when I'm streaming videos. Took a star off due to the generic email response from customer service	1

17276	My Samsung android hp cannot complete full installation, will hang at 98%. Kindly rectify this problem. Thanks.	1
17277	I want my phone replaced, by either you or Google. It left my phone in critical condition and unable to charge because the phone was so hot, I couldn't even touch it. Now its no good to anybody.	1
17278	It needs to run in the background with Bluetooth always turned on leading to high battery usage. For someone who doesn't have a charger or power bank handy, this is very inconvenient. In its current state, the app shouldn't be made the only app for scanning SafeEntry QR codes.	1
17279	Great apps for COVID Gen!	0
17280	Good	0
17281	No response to country selection. The icon is inactive	1
17282	What kind of an app is this? The app is continuously stopping, I even tried factory reset to install the app. Still the same.tried calling 109, they don't even answer. Can someone set this right? Changing my review: Finally got a very helpful person on 109 who helped me sort it out. Try requesting the OTP over mobile data instead of WiFi, remove any VPN on the mobile. Changed the rating as they are resolving the teething problems.	1
17283	I am struggle to log in the password	1
17284	The app is good but the battery drain especially over the past two days has been ridiculous. Also, my phone was heating up excessively. I was afraid to leave it charging unattended but it was losing battery power so fast that not even using on the charger made a difference. I had to uninstall because I thought my phone was going to go Samsung and burst into flames. Since uninstalling it it's charging faster and my phone has cooled down.	1
17285	draining battery, phone had to shut down due to power drain	1
17286	Hopeless app! Can't receive the OTP!!!	1
17287	after upgarde the app, it seems not showing the number of contact person. It is ok now to show the total number of exchanges.	1
17288	I tried to install this apps for my family members. Unfortunately this apps does not support old HPs. They are running Android version 5.0. :(	1

17301	A hassle to use. Waste my data and battery.	1
17302	Fail to create profile... Invalid NRIC number???	1

17307	Keep crashing after finishing it's registration	1
17308	Neat and clean app. Set and forget. Everyone should install this, there is no reason not to. Could do without the permanent notification that needs to remain active.	0

17322	Good apps	0
17323	Disappointed that the app cannot be used ij older smartphones such as my iPhone5. Low income and racialized communities are disproportionately affected by COVID and if the app only works on newer (expensive) phones we are potentially missing a large swath of people who would benefit from the app.	1
17324	I can not sign up to use this app since at the password screen I get the message that I have to meet the password policy and requirements although all the criteria is met.	1
17325	Very nice	0

17329	Nice app, easy to use. Ensure Bluetooth on and software up to date	0
17330	The app is not able to verify the code that they send via sms. Therefore app is not even opening.	1
17331	Worst experience its giving just no need to download its fake app just wastage of time in this critical situation.	1
17332	After installation, unable to connect with other bluetooth devices.	1
17333	Please enable 2FA SMS for dual SIM phones. I'm not receiving the SMS verification by SMS. there seem to be a few direct communications engines that will not send to dual SIM phones despite the number being verified being a Singapore number. Would be great if SG tech team could fix this. TIA. Thank you. It worked when I tried again. Probably my "user error". \ud83d\ude44 Fantastic initiative. Keep up.the good work! #SGUnited	1
17334	Giving this 5 stars because it is in English. Thank you very much for that	0
17335	I did COVID-19 test twice and neither of results are available in application. I contacted the customer support but it is still unresolved	1
17336	This kind of contact tracing is a great idea, and my research indicates next to no privacy issues.	0
17337	When it worked it was good. Had to remove it as it drained the battery and phone was burning up constantly.	1
17338	The app keeps on stopping	1

17345	I have been waiting for it to download for the past 1 hour. And No, it's not my internet connection. I used my mobile data(M1) and unsuccessful after 15 mins. Just keeps showing "preparing to download" . And I switched to my Wifi (singtel) and it has been preparing for another 15 mins already. I hope you guys can fix this problem.	1
17346	Just install it. Stop being selfish. Nobody cares about your data LOL	0
17347	This is the worst app in the univeasr	1
17348	The idea of the app is good, but since i install it, it conflicts with other apps, for instance the QNB mobile app it can't be loaded while Ehteraz is on i have to uninstall ehteraz, and install it back once I'm done with QNB app	0
17349	cannot open the app After the last update	1
17350	very good apps for Health.	0
17351	Will not accept my mobile number so cannot install the app. Tried 3 times!	1
17352	Works well and makes sense for everybody to have if we want to avoid lockdowns and tackle outbreaks. For those worried about being tracked , watsapp , facebook , Google all gather more information than an app that can save a life.	0
17353	There is an annoying notification banner that you can't disable that only says it is working. Let us turn this off.	1
17354	It's draining android phones	1
17355	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
17356	Salam, I am from UK, trying to sign up everytime get the error message saying (make sure information entered is correct). Could you please rectify the issue. Many thanks	1
17357	Apps don’t work in my device plz check it....urgent I Have need to your Feed back	1
17358	Hi, need some help as the app keeps telling me that i have a network issue when all my other apps and internet are working fine. Can't get past the OTP stage.	1
17359	Good	0
17360	I love it it's so helpful to keep track of COVID	0
17361	This is very good and useful. It has helped me a lot in this situation of pandemic. It informs us if we come in contact with a Corona positive person. It gives details about the current Covid-19 status and the number of people near me affected by Corona. This app is extremely user-friendly. Thank for creating this app. I'll recommend it to other.	0
17362	Needs location permission to access Bluetooth low energy, but doesn't do location requests, so battery consumption is low. It happily coexists with the Italian immuni app. This is important if you regularly cross FR-IT border. In principle this app should be valid for MC. When you first install it may take a few retries to activate the service. Don't worry, retry some hours later. It doesn't ask for any data.	1
17363	Excellent app for really important purpose, but wiping out mh battery. I've had to disable it, but it's so important I don't want to uninstall it yet- I read in the Irish Times the update fixing this was meant to come out last night. Hope it won't be too much longer. Otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars	1
17364	Not getting otp .. and battery daring too fast	1
17365	Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my husband's and my phones.	1
17366	After update suppose to allow student to register but it is not working. That way by selecting NRIC works. Thanks.	1

17378	Excellent	0
17379	I have noticed a significant increase in battery usage ever since I downloaded the app. Now I may have to charge my phone multiple times a day instead of just once.	1
17380	Am running new phone Android 10. No matter how many times I give it full permission, it says it is not authorised. Effectively, it doesn't work.	1
17381	It needs an automatic notification to do the daily Check In. You're reminded when you open the app, but not unless you go and look. Hopefully it will interoperate with whatever the UK produces for people who cross the border. Otherwise, just works.	1
17382	This app not work	1
17383	i am trying to install but its saying error requesting otp try again	1
17384	I took my test last week, i already recieved a text notification of the result of my covid test, but On the apps, it says "test is not available"	1

17387	Dear Team Bahrain, I appreciate your efforts to help keep us safe. However, I've been asked to upload selfies 4 times and I'm still half way through day 1. As I'm trying to work from home, this is proving to be rather annoying. My friends all have done the quarantine with the app but none of them are CONSTANTLY asked to submit photos. Please minimize asking us to submit photos every hour. I really don't think I need to submit over 60 photos in the span of 10 days and it's honestly annoying.	0
17388	Dependent on bluetooth connectivity too much for this app to have it constantly crashing. Always disconnecting from other devices. Uninstalling this app until reviews advise it's working better	1
17389	Not good app cannot register make it compatible to all android even 5.0.1 version do something.or youll making problem to those low version.its crisis and mandatory to download how can we buy a mobile again just to download this app. Fix this app	1

People said : is good chance to change the phone. So I buy another phone just for download this App. Cheers. I feedback just to let people know this App can't download or can't loading just because of your phone is too old. But some people said because their is Huawei brands so can not use Google / Appstore. I don't know.. Maybe..	1

If this dosnt get resolved I will.be in problem for onboarding a flight please help me .. waiting for your prompt Also shared email to support team but no revert yet ðŸ˜­	1
17420	The apple iOS version of this app gives weekly notifications saying you haven't come into contact with anyone covid positive. Why doesn't it do that for android? How can we have confidence that notifications are on and will tell you when you've come into contact with a positive case when the two versions do different things, and android doesn't even give you a weekly round up?	1

17431	Worst bloody app ever to install. Keep it simple idiots.	1
17432	Keeps you updated and will help if everyone used it, if your worried about giving away your data just by using Google, Facebook, Watts app etc then you have already given away all your data	1
17433	Alright, after rectification with the CSOs, the issue has been resolved. A suggestion would be to add a button for a camera scan where automatic *Check In/Out* occurs on camera scan. This is mostly for the older demographics who uses smartphones but are less literate. This autonomous check in/out only requires them to scan the QR code where they can also choose to tap to show the existing NRIC. Better to have more option for them.	1

17440	Easily installed... No problem so far.	0
17441	Good idea but crucial notification for status is still missing. It seems to work as intented but the design is not with actual users in mind. There is no indication on the status of the application running in the background. This leads to me forgetting turning it on and/or off as I have no idea without opening the app. Also there are too many steps to turn it on (3 taps is a lot).	1

17447	The color code is lost! Un installed and reinstalled Many times	1
17448	I want this app to work but I have to take battery back ups to go shopping for 2 hours, that's if it doesn't crash or freeze up. I think this is an important app, confused why it's completely hopeless. Needs a dramatic overhaul for the people that actually use and need it for work.	1
17449	No feedback on contacts, even ones without virus. Would be good to know how may connections have been made over time.	1

17461	I don't get proper performance of this apps it's been 20days suffer of showing question mark	1
17462	This is a great app and just what South Africa needs to avoid a second wave as restrictions lessen. However, the government now needs to promote the use of this app, explain how to set it up and make it clear that users’ privacy and anonymity is preserved. The app is only effective if a large portion of the population is using it, so it’s now time to raise awareness and educate the public.	0

17475	App says it "is active" and therefore should be working fine, however for the past 3 days plus today, it also states in the history tab that I have had zero exchanges with other people, which cannot be correct? Please investigate whether last update affected proper functioning as the app will be useless if so. Thanks.	1

17509	Installed the app 3 times now and whenever I open the app it makes me go through the setup steps again (as if i never opened the app before). After a couple of days when i open the app i get an error message and the app immediately closes when opening. Only an uninstall and reinstall works but the same behaviour again after that.	1

17566	Good	0
17567	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
17568	Have already posted a review but there's a few aspects that need to be improved, such as a wake up notification asking how you feel, a way for the app to turn on Bluetooth and scan in the background rather than having it on constantly, daily number of cases per county (cork +7 etc) and have the ability to have down times as there's no need to have it running when your asleep, have that settable by the users of course. And more symptoms need to be added aswell, tiredness, confusion, clumsy, etc	1
17569	Even after negative report co.es the app doest update the status whoch is such a deterrent.	1
17570	In Huawei nova 7i app not working still no working	1
17571	Excellent	0
17572	The app is perfect only i wish to get notifications when our results have been uploaded because now we have to click again and again without any knowledge if our results have been uploading or not. So it would be much better to inform us by sending notifications for each user whenever the results have been uploaded. Looking forward for this.	1
17573	If you get the invalid number message just turn off your WiFi, it seems to work that way. Hoping this gets fixed asap as it will stop many people from registering.	1
17574	This is best way	0
17575	If there is information about the current restriction it will be better.	1
17576	Safer than apple or google.... Safer than big business, big at or pharma	0

17626	Since few days application is not working and having a question mark on the health status so Oooops you are stuck and cannot go anywhere... The way to fix it: Mobile settings/Apps/Ehteraz/Storage/Clear cache/Clear data/launch the app and try to re-register (you might need to try 2 or 3 times coz of error msg) if still not working, restart the phone and try to re-register. Finally you are green again !	1

17647	This app is so frustrating. I cannot get past inputting my phone number. I have tried all the troubleshooting ideas everyone suggested in the reviews and in the FAQ part of the app, but it keeps saying invalid number. I have a oppo Reno z. I would like to do more to help the community with contact tracing but this buggy app makes it impossible.	1
17648	This app is dangerous. We need better data. The data it is too vague and out dated so as a result it causes a serious amount of complacency. I advise anyone getting this app to put the bluetooth feature on and set it and forget it.	1
17649	Why the app wants to access to my media files and phone calls? Location ok, I can understand.	1
17650	Why i don't have an option for my location? I am from City of Manila District III and it is not showing in the option. How can you monitor or trace with that? It keeps on asking to turn on my bluetooth, this should use GPS. This has been endorse by Yorme. Fix this.	1

17653	It was working fine when I first installed it. Now, all of a sudden it's telling me that there no internet connection. This happens when I'm connected to wifi or data. I've already tried to uninstall and reinstall the app with the same issue.	1

17669	Fine for a couple of weeks, then phone overheating and battery performance takes a nose dive. Plenty others seeing the same issues.	1
17670	Confusing. Should be SIMPLE !!!!	1
17671	Has this app been used to trace any of the recent clusters in NSW or any of the cases in Victoria? I'm wondering if it is worthwhile having it constantly running in the background burning battery power. There doesn't seem to be any mention of the app being used in the news. Otherwise the app works fine.	1
17672	A very bad app. It does not show Covid 19 test results.	1
17673	Rubbish. Can't launch the app so it's useless.	1
17674	Good idea but it drain battery from my iPhone faster then I have time to charge it.	1
17675	Very nice and follow the way please	0
17676	This app is not showing my result	1
17677	Would be useful but kills the battery.	1
17678	Add an autostart set up option for people, I frequently forget to turn it on when going out, so making it run automatically helps greatly.	1
17679	Not installing on Samsung Galaxy Note 3 thought my OS is Android 5.0. It's like...you like people to buy new mobile phone that suits the Application to be installed?! Seriously???! Please do an update for this because it is required to ALL people here in Qatar (from local citizens to expats). \ud83d\udc4d	1
17680	Apparently my phone number I've had for over 8 years is invalid. Tried 14 times, couldnt recieve a pin therefore couldnt register. Deleted app.	1

17713	Read in paper today that 500k people have uninstalled this app due to battery killing issue. How on earth is this issue not resolved at this stage??? This is going on 3 weeks now! Was in Donegal recently for 3 day break,staying in a busy hotel, it would have been extremely useful to have had this app but as it runs my battery down in 3 hrs not an option.

17743	Not working	1
17744	Works well except for yes, newer bluetooth transmissions will interfere with app getting location signals. Example: a colleague sends me a document at work through Bluetooth because there is no WiFi or email in the cold freezer. That doc will interrupt and cancel location-tracing signals. In other words, it is not foolproof. Will govt arrest those who switch off their Bluetooth? What abt those working from home in essential services? This does not allow me to give a fuller review.	1
17745	Excellent	0
17746	Good clear info, Would be good if when you select a county and then by two weeks or total, that the number at the top changes from just per day to match what you have selected on the graph.	0
17747	Unusable as I required to remove cam for my phone. There is not an option to key in the location like in the singpass app.	1
17748	Disrupts my Bluetooth ear piece intermittently	1
17749	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

17783	The use of Bluetooth was disruptive in the 1st version: if you were listening to music using a Bluetooth speaker, for instance, there was a 3 to 5 seconds pause every time you were in contact with someone using the same app. Very annoying! This new version has fixed this and the interruption is now very brief, 1 second or a bit less. Congrats to the dev team! I still hit a minor issue: my phone# was rejected when I tried to register. Closing and opening the app fixed the glitch.	1

17787	Basically another app to keep tabs on all of us.	1
17788	Very good	0
17789	Can't find any other way to contact the Coronalert team. I have a question: if my phone is sitting for 1h in a locker (e.g. at sports centre) and it catches the phone of a positive case, will the app flag me as a risk or will it somehow "understand" the situation? Why wouldn't the app reveal the WHEN of a potential contamination ? that would enable me to understand at least that it was in those circumstances? And don't tell me the obvious, to turn bt on and off as I will certainly forget...	1
17790	Disgusting apps	1
17791	Very good app	0
17792	Great	0
17793	Ver good idea to monitor & track people during COVID-19 issue	0
17794	Can i login without emirates id	1
17795	The theory behind the app is great, but it needs to work properly. The notification symbol my phone keeps disappearing, does this mean it's not on and working?	0
17796	Many times when using the safe entry option I get an error saying not a valid QR code. But if I switch to my phone camera it works perfectly. So there is some problem with the QR scanning on some codes. Also many times I scan a code and the app just gets stuck with spinning blue circle. This seems to happen a lot when I've done safe entry once and then do it again for a second place soon after (eg first safe entry is a mall, second safe entry is a shop within the mall). App not really up to standard at the moment because of these problems, and I am sure it's the app only as using phone camera and web-based safe entry works fine.	1
17797	Good	0
17798	App crash. Can't open apps it's crash always	1
17799	Thank you	0
17800	Good App	0
17801	can't really tell if it works - should be a displayed count of people you've been in contact with to show it's working. Need an "i think i have it but haven't been tested" option - I'm sure many won't bother with a test. wasn't sure it had correct permissions - on android 10 there is option of permission only while app is open in foreground - which obvs is no good for this, and if i open the app it often says initially that it isn't active!	1
17802	I've downloaded the app and to my surprise all traces of the covid19 has left my body I have never felt this secure ever since the sgsecure app summoned thanos to snap my bullies away. Now sg is safe from crime and is also prepared for diseases good job sg	0
17803	Good	0
17804	Just no	1
17805	GOOD	0
17806	App is so damn laggy	1
17807	Does not show if anyone nearby has been tested positive or been in contact with a positive case. It would work better if linked with phone number & UAE ID for those who do not sign up. It will be more efficient.	0
17808	Can't get it operating because every time I request a pin I have to complete all the sections afaon & the pin is icorrect. Worst design I have ever encountered	1
17809	It drains my phone batt like crazy. After installing the app i need to charge 3times in a day when my phone is just fine without having to charge the whole day after i uninstall. Pluss it keep messing up my bluetooth headphones. Its convenient in a way where it saves the qr code of freq places. The Cons weight out the pros. Until they fix this i womt be using it.	1

17813	I like it	0
17814	Facing the same issue as other users as well. Thought my wireless earbuds has started to be faulty but once I saw the reviews it was actually this app interrupting the bluetooth connection, making my music I am listening to stop for a split second sometimes. Hope something is being done to fix this if Singapore is pushing for more people to use TraceTogether. :)	1
17815	How to switch user in this app if login with different emirates ID and different mobile number ( I can see an option to add user with same mobile number of existing ID). Please help	1
17816	Good initiative	0
17817	Works okay with Moto G5	0
17818	Superb	0
17819	A very useful platform which helps to periodically check the status of Corona virus personally, and the neighbours who reach in the vicinity of this application particularly, and thus building a self confidence in the application holder, observing the owner is corona free.	0
17820	After latest update it has been sitting with bluetooth and location permissions not declared and now I have to reregister. It's been sitting like that for a week so totally useless. Still interferes with any device running Bluetooth Classic e.g. Car handsfree.	1
17821	Can't b installed in my mobile Samsung note 8	1
17822	Easy to set up. Hope we get on top of Covid 19	0
17823	The app alerted me 8 days later of a possible exposure? How is that going to curb the spread at all?	1
17824	I have install it in my Fone ..but its not working..	1
17825	Works now... I mean the registration... Concerned about battery life because seems to work in the foreground... After a couple of days, it definitely reduces battery life. Ok you got to do a better version...	0
17826	This is frustrating. The app just refuses to validate my particulars. I have no idea what's wrong with my name and nric. It just keeps saying validation fail.	1
17827	Good	0
17828	Worst app ever built, poor battery usage, poor coding. Novel idea but made the worst way possible. My phone battery will not even last a few hours with it running, where it can nornally last a day without. What is the point of a dead phone in this case? I hope the developer will never make another app in his or her lifetime.	1
17829	great app	0
17830	Recent update was the worse. I have been using this since launch and had no issue until recent update. The app cannot detect nearby users with bluetooth, and is a battery monster. Have uninstall already.	1

17832	Well done	0
17833	You have to have your Bluetooth on & even when your offline, saying to turn Bluetooth on, shouldn't when WiFi not on.	1

17840	App is very good but much better if it shows how many affected per day also. Just a suggestion	0
17841	I uninstalled it , because I could only get it in finish. No option to change it to Swedish inside the app.	1
17842	We can be confident and we are always safe,thanks to all	1
17843	After the update, whenever I click safe entry the app crashes!	1
17844	Keeps crashing	1
17845	Update: Initial force-close issue resolved by reinstalling. Haven't heard of the app actually doing its job yet and at what accuracy rate, but I guess it's better than nothing.	1
17846	App is extremely slow. Amd stuck on surway screen as submit button is disabled and I dont have any pre conditions	1

17861	Why not have a sign in button when people got to Venues such as restruants as a digital sign. And have the the Maitre D or someone from the venue witness the customer signing in. That way it won't breach the Privacy ACT as opposed to the current system implemented	1
17862	This app is not good but this app is very very good I love this App	0
17863	Good for our Safety in Qatar, But no 5 STAR besause it get access to our internal storage and also the battery drains faster.	0

17866	Had it on all day and so far app is reporting 0% battery usage. So far so good.	0
17867	Received onetime password, but when entered the password, displayed: "could not load user's information, please try later". I tried several times, but displayed the same message.	1
17868	Though the app has relevant information, however it would be better to include graphs and pie charts showing various stats. This would enhance the interest of the user. Moreover, additional links to various stats should also be created i.e age group, male, female etc.	1
17869	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
17870	what about version for old model phones??? Does every one in Qatar have latest phones. MOI plz make it available for all first, then make it mandatory. u cant go for grocery now without it	1
17871	I am unable to check out so I would be checked in for hours. I have already switched on my mobile data and bluetooth. When I pressed the checkout button, they said there was a network issue and told me to check my connection.

17894	It is not even opening... every time it says app has been closed.. crashing every time.. even i uninstall and install it again but same problem	1
17895	Not good	1
17896	I think the app should notify the user (maybe it already does) if he or she installs it, but somehow forgets or skips the setup (Bluetooth and running in the background). It actually happened to me. I opened the app a few hours later to discover that I needed to go through the setup, which was "hidden" behind the 'Help' button.	1
17897	Seamless performance, could do with more functionality to keep the user engaged	0
17898	Downloaded app i was in touch with 3 people who tested positive nothing came up i rang the helpline says not to worry its not 100%	1
17899	Not sure if I have been in contact with someone who has covid-19 as it says matches but never received an alert although I'm us a huawei p30 Pro so not sure if that's got to do with it?	1

17903	I was very happy that Singapore MOH addressed my previous feedback about allowing outside phone number country codes to sign up for the app, which was shared with me that it will be included in the next release	0

Truth is I never ever sign up for anything in UAE with my home country number. Kindly fix urgently as my work requires I get tested every two weeks. Thanks.	1

17982	This app will work with Bluetooth which is useless service. If we off the Bluetooth service then it cannot identify the Corona effected person.

17989	Works fine on Samsung S7. No conflicts with any of the 4 Bluetooth speakers and headsets I regularly use for music and calls.

17996	If you use Media Volume Sync, so that the phone remembers the volume level for BT connected devices and a separate volume level for wired headphones, the covidsafe app will switch volumes between the BT level and the wired level when it handshakes with another covidsafe app. This has proved to me that the app cannot measure distance as my volume level changes when people walk by my house (at least 5 metres away from where I am sitting). Since the update, this issue has increased in frequency.	1

18039	I had the app for more than 2 weeks and it was working well. It updated yesterday and stopped working, I've tried to uninstall and reinstall but it keeps crashing. It doesn't even open for me to register. If the app is mandatory then they need to fix these issues because now we need it to enter supermarkets and when we go to work	1
18040	Kept disconnecting my bluetooth connection	1
18041	Fantastic app for keeping us safe, you can use a different name they said on the news, and it does not take your location only other covid users who have the app, and their phone number, easy simple to install.	0
18042	I saw an dialog saying this app will log locations for debugging purpose after an update. But the installed app says they do not log location and access to location is required for bluetooth only. However the app keeps showing warning until you turn on GPS. It does not make sense.	1

18046	Worst experience	1
18047	Cant get past phone number	1
18048	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0
18049	Battery drain, I've followed steps uninstall, Google play-deleting cache and re installing but if it continues I'll be deleting as not much point in having it if my phones dead all the time	1
18050	Good, would be great if it didn't automatically select your system language. I like English for my setting but not on every single app i use ??.	0

18059	Useless app. It keeps saying that the QR code can't be detected even though it works fine for my colleagues using the same code. Uninstall and reinstall countless times, now I'm stuck at the OTP portion since now the OTP can't be recognized and I can't even register.	1
18060	Useless and extra burden	0
18061	The app wud serve purpose if it had provisions to include people whose QID has expired. As the same people are unable to leave country due to travel restrictions. Imagine if any of such people are infected with covid, cannot be tracked...	1

18074	I had a question mark appearing on my QR, so I contacted the call center they said it should be good after I uninstall and reinstall after 24 hrs. I did that, then the app sent me a verification code which I entered correctly, yet it failed and said it was the wrong pin. I entered that pin again in the time frame provided then I got locked out multiple trials to log in. I contacted the call center everyday in the past 4 days and they say it will take 24 hrs to be resolved. Pls resolve ASAP	1
18075	I charged my phone to 100% last night and this morning after 3 hours it was below 20% because this app sucked the power out of it	1

18080	It was nice to know there's an useful apps related to Covid -19 specifically when we are at a red zone or in a crowd, our mobile will beep. Then I installed it but at some other time, when I tried to open the apps, it does not work, the apps closed directly. Anyway, I don't know if it''s really useful or not.	1
18081	App-solute rubbish ! Caused some Bluetooth glitches with existing paired devices in the phone, have since removed app with no further issues.	1

18103	The intention is good but this app is so rushed it brings more problem to the user ranging from overheat, PRIVACY, risk of getting hacked, etc. Just read through the reviews. If its possible to put 0 or 0.5 star people will do it. I hope this gets fixed asap!!!	1
18104	Not working in oppo f1s	1
18105	Always says it's inactive	1
18106	It drains your battery because it needs Bluetooth etc to work. Plus it has a notification displayed all day everyday.	1
18107	Having problems checking in on establishments with error that the qr code is not recognizeable. Tried to reinstall and then was able to checkin. But now I am not able to checkout. The app says there is no internet connection even though I am connected to wifi or using data.	1

18116	I installed this app, and through the setup process it informed me that for it to work, it is mandatory for me to give my permission for it to access my location. A major red flag for me, so i like many others will be uninstalling this app immediately after i submit this review. They say that it's an Android thing, but i have other apps that use bluetooth without requiring my location. It's a liberal party lie. They say xx people have downloaded it, i bet that number doesn't reduce when deleted	1

18124	TBH if its going to notify me while at work that someone has tested positive, then great stuff! I work customer service and have people from everywhere still coming thru the doors (service station) so that to me is a huge positive! No issues with this app, having Bluetooth on its not that much of an issue so not sure why people are going on about it. Been enough experts and people involved in the app speaking up about it for me to be happy.	1

18126	So far so good. No complaints here.	0

18134	Very funny.. i type my ic number till can't work..	1
18135	Tedious waste of time, why not use the already present qr code scan or ID card instead of this useless app. I want to remain private and that choice should be respected not forced upon by a bunch of fools who don't have an ID scanner	1
18136	Good	0
18137	i am in 24 curfew zone and its still not giving me normal supply permit. only emergency supply for one hour at a time.	1
18138	Honestly lost faith in the app. I have to check my exposure logs regularly to ensure it's actually checking every 2 hours. I've had days where only a single check has been made by the app. I've also had 3 instances of the exposure logs showing a match but no indication from the app that this has happened or what it means.	1
18139	App looks good and is a good measure for safety. Unfortunately I get an error in the notification dropdown: "App currently unable to function properly, an unexpected error occurred when synchronzing the notifications". Until this gets fixed it's 1 star from me.	0
18140	Purpose is only private data collection of people through their smart phone	1
18141	Need improvement	0
18142	Can the app start by itself when ever I turn on the phone? Can the notification run in the background	1
18143	When try to open the apps it hang half way through can the admin fixed this?	1
18144	Nice	0
18145	When we change to new phone the app seems to remember the ip address of old phone. It do not allow uis to install the tracetogether in my new phone when we transfer the sum card to new phone. But.... On the old phone we can uninstall and reinstall to the old phone only. The OTP will not deliver if we try to install to new phone.	1
18146	Good App	0
18147	Very good and reliable	1
18148	Last update is absolutely murdering my battery, like others have said if I have to turn it off to save battery then what's the point of having it at all?	1
18149	Few things you have to look into. Its asking for the number you used when applying for the emirates ID even though your giving your updated number at the center of testing. That means you cant know if ur positive and in contact with others? Then whats the use of the app? It takes long time to generate the results.	1
18150	I cant open this app.its always unfortunely stop when i open it.why?	1
18151	I think this app is causing bad connection for my bluetooth ear pcs to my hp. Having bad connection ever since I installed. With the latest update,is getting even worse!	1

18189	Connection issue on WiFi and 4g. Doesn't work. Pointless app if half the people can't use it.	0
18190	Its dumb	1
18191	When there are a lot of people nearby, eg shopping mall . MRT, it causes Bluetooth disconnected and reconnected 5s later. Results my Bluetooth earphones can't use normally. Work around: force stop this app.	1

18194	Like many other as of the 8th of August my phone is overheating and the battery being drained within an hour or so, the only warning coming up is for this app. Was working very well but not as of Saturday.

18199	A chart with total confirmed ICUs over time would be very helpful, as confirmed cases depend too much on the size of the tested sample, ICU seems to be a better measure to understand the context. Also, a push notification to confirm "how do you feel today" could improve usability and potentially increase data collection	1
18200	Couldn't register.	1
18201	I have the same problem as Ben Parker. My Android keeps turning off the battery optimization setting so the app disables itself after approximately five minutes. Therefore the app is useless to me. I have reinstalled it to no avail. I have an OPPO A73 with up to date software version 7.1.	1
18202	I have no confidence that this app is even working, the only thing I have noticed is the obstrusive notification bar and the drain on my battery. Here is an idea, have a count that gets updated when you connect with someone. That would help increase my confidence. Additionally, have an option to enable automatically only when away from home, or leaving a specific WiFi network.	1

18205	On my phone, background exposure checks are not regularly performed. Last one was 5 days ago (!), in the past 14 days only 8 checks were made. I suspect this is an API issue rather than an app issue, but it seriously decreases effectiveness of the app. I wonder if it might be possible to add a manual "check now" button.	1

18207	Hi I have noticed when i close all apps on my phone and open up again the app is displaying NOT ACTIVE for a few seconds before turning ACTIVE.

18213	FANTASTIC APP & BRILLIANT IDEA	0
18214	App almost unusable anymore. Since one week, the app consumption has gone from 2-3% to around 30% of the battery, leading to an early shutdown of the device which therefore isn't tracing anymore. And if we want to save the battery then we have to stop the app which, of course, stop the tracing either. Early user of this app, I'm really convinced of its value, so it's really sad that developers have made a version which will have a negative impact on the contact tracing overall. EDIT : @Government Technology Agency : I had reached out to your support center before, but as per your comment, I've just sent an email to your services with all detailed infos.	1
18215	Update Nov 2020: Uninstalled due to battery drain and overheating on a Galaxy S10 5G. Too risky to leave installed. No issues on Galaxy A30. Down to 4 stars. Original Review: Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers. Original review 5 stars.	1

18277	Edit: GOOD NEWS.... Finally its working.. it's working with ANDROID 10. Previous :.. ITS NOT WORKING WITH ANDROID 10... What an Irony....COME ON YAA.... GROW UP...

18284	Had problem singing up but that was fixed in later updates. Although the app is good i dont see any info related to tracking. Atleast show users travel history map. I know its being recorded than why not show as well. In addition the app should be able to automatically turn on bluetooth/wifi once permissions are given. Not sure why you keep asking the user every single time	1

Hope the authorities are not relying on data from this app !!	1

18302	Very useful great	1

18304	Need to improve the functionality. Di pa sya fully developed, more on graphical user interface palang yung nakikita namin. Need to fix bugs, errors and database for effectiveness of this app. Do some surveys or studies if needed, magdagdag ng developer kung kailangan, kasi malaking tulong talaga to sa panahon ngayon and please wag po sanang sayangin ang budget at time habang may panahon pa. We are expecting the good outcome of this.	1

18306	The constant run on background cause phone to lag and causes difficulties in unlocking phone. I appreciate the intentions of the app, I have no intention of not using it but please developers iron out the issues. I'm using s20+.	1

18317	Not working	1
18318	Within 2 hours of use, phone battery is down to 50%, there.is a slight heating of the phone since the App is always braodcasting.	1

18320	Tell us more (optional)	1
18321	They said it does not require location services. After recent update, does not work without location services "on". Very supportive of the government and the purpose of the app, but I don't allow any app to use my location services unless it is necessary for the use of the app. Your location is not required for the purpose of the app, especially when the government said that it does use your location.	1
18322	This app has stopped capturing data via bluetooth no matter how many times I try to install it or upgrade it. Does not give correct information as before. Make no sense to keep it now.	1
18323	I don't understand it. How does it work, it doesn't favor everyone in their class. Only for rich citizens.	1
18324	Easy to install, safe	0
18325	I am Sengkang resident. Compass One mall unable to scan my barcode in the app and I had to take out my NRIC. Please reach out to Compass One to upgrade their scanner. If I am able to use the barcode at a small Fairprice outlet at Compassvale Link, why can't a big mall like Compass One do it. The guy at the entry point told me to use SingPass mobile, I went into the app to find safe check-in location, I can't even locate Compass One!	1

18336	Again an app designed by morons. If you use bt, why need all the personal data? PDPA says only ask for the personal data you need for the task at hand. Is the government not bound to its own laws? Seems like. And then you have to keep bt on and running this monster in background - but you still have to scan into each and every location you enter??? You guys actually understand WHY you added the bt feature??? Seems not. Embarrasing.	1

18346	Everyone in Australia should get the app, let's protect each other..., however weeks later I have had to down rate as it just doesn't stay on. I have tried locking the app on my Oppo phone and changing battery permission, but the next time I look it has been disabled automatically because of the 'high power consumption' Not good enough unfortunately.	1

18359	Worst app.	1
18360	The app provides very limited information, it notified me that I was in contact with a confirmed case in a place I never was (and would probably never go) but there is no way to click on the location and just see it on a map. Only after checking on Google maps and finding the location was a few kilometers from my home was I absolutely sure that it was a mistake.	1

18381	The app had some issues with android 10 phones but finally it has been rectified. Thank you for acting that fast.	1
18382	Make it open source and I'll add the fifth star. Using the application a mandatory step to stop the pandemic. By making it open source, you would basically avoid negative comments on data protection and probably get more people to install it.	1
18383	why need access my all files and storage????????????? It is ruining our privacy.	1
18384	Excellent	0
18385	Great concept to keep us safe. Signing up was easy and I don't feel like it's actually tracking me to the extent some of you make it. Just hooks up to other Bluetooth devices I've been near and informs if they do get infected. I'll do anything to help stop the spread and keep my family safe.	0

18405	Why should I allow the permission to access my photos videos files on my device? Is it not possible to use this app without allowing this access?	1

18440	So your supposed to leave your bluetooth and location on while using contact tracing but this app drains the battery. Why can't you just use mobile data instead of bluetooth and what if people have other apps in the background while this app is running, can you please fix this issue.	1
18441	Very Good	0
18442	As of today (13/8) I get alerts that the app isn't active. When I open the app, it decides it's active. When I go into settings, I ensure that it can access location at all times. But I still keep getting this alert. It stops being active when I lock the phone.	1
18443	Very very poor rated app. I hate this app. It is useless and it have so many bugs. If there is 0 star or deslike option I would select this. I suggest not to install this app.	1

18459	There's no use of this app, though they made it mandatory	1
18460	Please help me to delete obsolete entries. Thanks so much.	1
18461	I'm giving this app 1 star, I'd give minus if possible. For MONTHS, I cannot even get the OTP. Kept prompting 'check your Internet connection and try again, there seems to be a network issue'. I am so pathetic I have no WiFi at home, no phone data. That's what you telling me right? Now you telling us this app or your token is the only way do a safe entry check in/out? This app SUCKS now you want us to carry another token around. Hey thank you for the idea but make sure it works.	1

18480	Is the battery drain issue STILL not fixed? I appreciate that this was caused by a problem introduced by a Google Play Services update, but surely this should already be addressed by now - it's been several days. My wife's phone was affected, and I had to clear data from Google Play Services to fix that, and it's been fine since, but still... This issue has undermined all your efforts, and it needs to be resolved sooner than this.	1

18483	Causes connection issue for my bluetooth devices. Hard to continue using even if I want to	1
18484	On...Off problem. If anyone else is having the problem this should help. When you first install the app, it requests certain permissions, these I gave, and this should then overide any general app permissions on your phone and treat this app as an exception because you agreed to allow them, this works for the other apps on my phone, however, with this app, for some reason, you need to go into your app management and give the permissions exclusively for the covidsafe app.	1
18485	good	0
18486	The app works, but only does half its job. If I enter a restaurant, why do I need yet another app to track I’m there??  All contact tracking should be provided by a single app.	1

18489	Trying to enter the pin the app texts you is incredibly annoying. The app closes every time you try to open your texts to see the pin resulting in you needing to re-enter your details and start again with a new pin then repeating again and again.

18504	Good intentions but the given reason it wants Location Permissions is not true - as far back as June 2019 Google has already told developers you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a (Bluetooth) scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	1
18505	Pls remove the notification that always shows on the notification bar. It's very annoying.	1
18506	I think that Bluetooth permission don't need it	1
18507	Good idea, but needs fix for the SafeEntry scanner. I have to say, the SingPass guys did wonders to their scanner!	1
18508	Good	0
18509	The app is causing a much faster battery drain on my Samsung A70. It also causes my Bluetooth speaker to constantly drop connections for 30 seconds. This app completely takes over control of Bluetooth preventing me from turning off Bluetooth at night when I am home to save battery. These are things that I would not tolerate in any other app.	1
18510	Goverment mass spying.	1
18511	Useless app. For months i have been trying to use this app. It only state no internet connection inspite of my phone data being active.

18541	Help! My device does not support exposure notifications! My phone is Samsang S10e, after I installed the app it just show me Covid-19 notification could not be activated, I don't konw how to fix it! I really want to use this app and i think all the requirements are reasonable, but i just can't use it on my phone, it's sad.	1
18542	Pretty useless	1

18544	First of all you need a ridiculously long password that nobody remembers! Of course I forgot it but when I tried to reset password it never sent me the code. I tried 3x over 2 days and checked my spam every time but nope. Also have friends who actually use it but when they scan code nothing comes up	1
18545	Why can't download this App	1
18546	I dont break any laws and have regular health checks, I have nothing to either fear or hide. I object to the heavily federally weighted installation of this app on historical grounds - auspol's long history with confidentiality breaches. I have this and the info app installed, along with what feels to be a complimentary ankle bracelet, despite which this may one day save a life. If I had a family who gave a damn about me I'd be more trusting of my government- you've never protected me before.	1

18548	I am Sengkang resident. Compass One mall unable to scan my barcode in the app and I had to take out my NRIC. Please reach out to Compass One to upgrade their scanner. If I am able to use the barcode at a small Fairprice outlet at Compassvale Link, why can't a big mall like Compass One do it. The guy at the entry point told me to use SingPass mobile, I went into the app to find safe check-in location, I can't even locate Compass One!	1

18561	After testing the latest update, I have found that it is, at very least, on a technical level, functional.  It still unnecessarily stores user data on a server, uses keys which are not truly anonymous, and transmits your device model publicly.  Once decentralised key exchange replaces the current system, either by an independent update, or by the implementation of the system in production by Apple and Google, I will update this to five stars.  For the time being, I would also like an update so that tracing can be temporary disabled from within the app, without having to revoke it\u2019s permissions or turn off bluetooth entirely, as there is no point leaving tracking enabled when I am separated from my phone.	1

18626	After the latest update (2.0.15), there seems to be something wrong with the number of 'exchanges' with other trace together users. Previously, even visiting downstairs to the supermarket would show something like 25 exchanges.

18717	Stupid app, you need to leave the app to see the pin sent but when you go back in the app starts from the beginning and you are sent a new pin. I was going to use but now deleted. Typical Gov initiative all noise no substance. This has nothing to do with the earlier problem of not being able to register either.	1

18736	Given that this app essentially never has screen time I would have thought it would be painless to use, however it's a battery killer. On my year old iPhone 11 pro it consumes 27% of my battery. Which is twice as much as the next nearest app. Since I started using it this summer. I thought it was perhaps an anomaly from earlier versions so I reinstalled a month or so ago.   It didn't take it long to move back to the number 1 battery using app at 27%. I'll keep using it since it serves a good public purpose, but I would appreciate it more if it was more efficient. Thanks for your efforts.	1
18737	Get it running people and join the community to fight against the virus. Taiwan and Singapore has been doing this for a long while, especially Taiwan and no one there is complaining about invasion to privacy while they have the virus all under control.

18769	This app was good only for 1 month after that till u uninstall this app it will not work still i was in home because of this app not working i can't go to my office it was showing only Exceeded number.\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fi stuffed wid diz hope diz will closed soon \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f	1

18777	In this time of pandemic applications like this is really needed. We can report our health conditions easily and scan if there are any confirmed cases in the area. I recommend to all Filipinos to use this app so we can help each other to prevent from being infected. This is modern bayanihan. Salute to the team who developed this! Lets all stay safe!	0

18782	This app is good in theory but it's got a problem when I'm listening to music with Bluetooth it will cut my music out now and then like a really weak signal unless this is fixed soon probs gonna uninstall	0
18783	Really this app very good app....	0
18784	A great initiative by our government but the programmers should consider to update the app to run in the background. \n\nI don’t think the older generation is aware that you have to have the phone ON at all times for this app to work and that they should use the “power save mode”. If while having a meal at a restaurant, and your phone’s screen turns off, the app will not work based on the “power save mode” instructions. \n\nIt is also currently unclear if we need to be on the app at such times or can it run while whilst we are on other apps? \n\nI hope the app can improve soonest! \nThank you for working tirelessly in the meantime!	0
18785	What is this? Can't even sign in. Useless app. If can give 0 star I more happy. Waste time/data/battery.	1

18790	Traffic overload. Always getting failed responses on registering, sending otp, adding family, protect me button, covid updates, more.	1
18791	Update: Thank you for prompt reply and fixing the battery issue. Good app but having similar issue as other users. Battery drainage issue. It used to be good but now it consume more battery power in the background comparing to initial versions. Please fix this. Samsung S10 user.	0
18792	Wooohhhhh good for health services.........	0
18793	Good	0
18794	Not bad. But please give android users group check in as well. I need to check on my kids. Children with trace together toggle is jus not a good combo. You know how fast they lose their wallets and water bottles?	0
18795	There's no group check-in option. Understand that only android phone dont have this option. My version is 2.3.11 while my friend who is using iphone has version 2.4 with group check-in option available. When then android user be given group check-in option?	1
18796	I tried to keep using it but had to remove it since it broke notifications on the lock screen. Galaxy S20. It would cut off half the notification or not even show some.	1
18797	When I do the check in, the number of people logo uses a light green background with white text. Cannot read that from a distance and the ambassador had to come close to read.	1
18798	easy to use	0
18799	Pros : 1. One stop management without having to move between apps like camera and Google chrome to check in/out Cons : 1. Drains battery of mobile phone alot faster before installation. 2. Affects stability of bluetooth connections between mobile phone and other devices such as wireless earphones. Connections either hanged or dropped intermittently	1
18800	The app install and registration was very smooth for me, and as far as I can tell the app seems to be working fine with no obvious impact on battery life. Great to see the government get this out of the door so early compared to most other countries - I hope it gets used by enough people!	0

18817	App is not working since update day before. Closing itself..	1
18818	Unable to submit nric to register. Will the app still work if so? Would be easy for user if u include a form to share what is the problem within the same platform. Having to open my email to contact developer regarding a problem on the app is a hassle.	1

18821	Just updated. It asked for my NRIC details. Cannot proceed as it keeps saying validation failed for NRIC field. Please fix.	1
18822	Update app to min android v8 and above so that Bluetooth does not require location. Alternatively, on devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, you can use the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.	1
18823	Please advise us: How can we submit the complain against very bad behaviour of GOVT STAFF in GOVT HOSPITALS?	1

18836	Fill in all required fields as per NRIC, but kept prompting as invalid and no way to complete registration?! Uninstall and reinstall again to try, but still facing same issue, so uninstall...	1
18837	Well I've tried twice. Uninstalling for good now. It continuously turns off my Bluetooth even though I chose not to worry about battery life. And I hear on the news it isn't even turned on anyway!!	1
18838	Thank you for this very disappointing app!!! If only i could give a zero. I came back from my home country and finished quarantine, but it took 45 days for this stupid app to turn to green (informed the hotline but did nothing just told me "its okay, just wait". then, It turned green for only 2 days then it went question mark until now, did restarting my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled, called the hotline (did not helped a bit). Now, I can't even buy my own groceries for more than 2 months.	1

18878	Bad	1
18879	I'd like to suggest a feature that would be very useful and make the app more efficient. Since the app relies on location data users should be able to provide their home address and when they are at that location the app deactivates the Bluetooth search and turns it on when the phone leaves that location. Furthermore, promotion via TV, billboards, newspaper and social media should be initiated so the coverage among the population increase significantly.	0

18899	Great idea, But, Sadly the app often becomes unresponsive to touches. The UI could have been a bit better, And more minimalistic. And there should be an option to change font size and the font itself, and Dark Mode could've been nice as well. After all, a great app which uses modern technology but sadly it is released too late, and most of the other apps in the world were already using this technology.	0

18929	v1.0.39 for Android is a dud. After this update was installed on my phone, the appl displayed "COVIDSafe is not active" instead of active. The settings in the appl now needs the permission change "Location: On" to go into the active state. Users should not need to change the appl settings for COVIDSafe for it to continue to operate correctly after an update. Also, if you enable this permission in the appl and then turn off the phone's Location/GPS, then "COVIDSafe is active" is shown in the notification bar but "COVIDSafe is not active" is shown in the appl - So is it active or not?	1

This should be written into the app, otherwise too many frustrated people will ditch it. Developers need to ensure the process is easy for everyone.	1

It does cut out the bluetooth on my cars speakers as I drive past others - I guess they have it? It's a little clunky but seems to be ok. Concerned about the location tracking on it - need to investigate.	1

18963	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery.

18964	Nice	0
18965	Pretty useless if you think about it. The app asks the user if he's okay and shows the same on the dashboard. Doesn't make sense to use that status as verification for any purpose. I don't understand how airports, hotels etc. are still using this.	1

19035	Tracker is working now that I've stopped the phone from optimising battery on the app. It's saving keys! The contact tracing only says it's not active when you boot it because it's doing a check that it's running. It is still actually working! Brilliant stuff. Love that it's open source, all the techies have said how well made this app is for GDPR etc. Well done Tramore	0

19037	Help stop coronavirus, STAY HOME as much as you can. SAVE LIVES KEEP a safe distance, Wash hands often, Cover your cough, SICK? See doctor. Install Trace Together App and support community, #SGUnited...	0
19038	Keep crashing bluetooth app (user might experience this as bluetooth app rebooting), resulting in frequent reconnections to other bluetooth devices. Fix it or you will see more pp force stop the app after checking in, defeating the purpose of contact tracing.	1
19039	I appreciate the privacy concerns but if the app guarantees privacy and annonimity, reporting should not be optional. Half measures are not an effective strategy. Tie it to medical records if the law allows	1

19085	It is inaccurate as far as Quetta and Balochistan are concerned. Where we are experiencing a surge in infections, the app still shows just a single affected location.	1
19086	While out and about on a full working day, with numerous SafeEntry check-ins and check-outs, the app reported ZERO (0) Bluetooth exchanges, even though there were many encounters with others. Surely, it is improbable that all these people are not using TraceTogether. During the day, I had my phone paired via Bluetooth to my smart watch. If I can't use TraceTogether with other Bluetooth devices, then it is not totally unacceptable.	1
19087	Nice	0
19088	Very bad user interface, lags, and causes my device to heat up and crash	1
19089	Downloaded app. In two minutes the OTP expires and does not allow end user to reinstall app. 2nd time no OTP number given for verification. Same with mother's and sister's phone. 1st time entering pin no. it says incorrect. Which is odd given we had quickly written the 6 digit numbers needed. While app is to assist in tracing, to upload is user unfriendly	1
19090	Good app	0
19091	Absolutely shocking battery drainage. Pointless if my phone keeps dying!!	1
19092	Same as all the other recent reviews - since the most recent update it's been draining the battery so badly. Phone cant last a few hours of non-use without needing a charge. Samsung S8	1
19093	Installed and it started causing my phone to have massive buffering issues with videos, uninstalled and problem was fixed straight away.	1
19094	This app uses up over 600MB of memory in the background! I mean why so much memory is needed!? You need to improve the app, low-end phones won't be able to run this app with the amount of memory needed!!! ??	1
19095	Poor. I can't receive the verification code to activate the registration process. There seems to be a problem with foreign phones and the app can't send the verification to these phones. This problem has existed for sometime but there hasn't been a fix.	1
19096	Good	0
19097	I\u2019m a sceptic when it comes to government apps but I read the Privacy Policy and felt reassured that I could use a fake name, only asked for my age range, postcode and phone number. I was reassured my location is not tracked or recorded and it\u2019s deleted every 21 days. The app only works on Bluetooth signal strength vicinity to record distance from potential infected people. Reassured and feel like I\u2019m doing my bit for my friends, family and country co I can be contacted ASAP if I came close to anyone who ends up infected.  Brilliant bit or technology actually. I turn off at night when I\u2019m sleeping into \u2018Airplane Mode\u2019 so it not emitting signals while I sleep.    If you\u2019re an Aussie and care you\u2019d download it too and delete this app in a month or so when this all blows over!  \ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udf7b	1

19099	At first this app give me permission & next time after a week I tried to take permission it doesn't work	1
19100	App requires usage of bluetooth which interfere with my other apps. I have to close this dumb app to use other app	1
19101	Don't work on p40 pro.	1
19102	I have an up-to-date iPhone 5S and I can’t download the app. It’s not a very good public safety tool if it can’t be used. I hope the developers make this app workable on more than just the newest phones.	1
19103	Masha Allah The app is really nice and very easy to use. This is another big success of our KSA Gov and its officials to fight against Corona pandemic. Big thanks	0
19104	Good Application To Know The Overall Status Of Covid-19	0
19105	Good app	0
19106	The app is very buggy. I am using s10+ and the app kept interrupting my Bluetooth earpiece(apple airpod) every 2 to 3 seconds when I am out in the public. I had no problem with my earpiece when I uninstall the tracetogether app. Please do something about it.	1
19107	Uses too much of my battery	1
19108	It keeps closing...not very useful when I get home and realise it hasn't been tracking. I make sure I reopen the app every morning but it closes within a couple hours. I have selected the not allowed option within battery optimisation, so it's not due to that. Update: newer updates have fixed this issue	1
19109	Once I installed it affected the way all my other phone apps run. I had to uninstall to get my Bluetooth with the car working properly again all though I still have issues, suddenly all my banking apps are no longer working. One app shouldn't cause these problems but it only started once I installed the app.	1
19110	Keeps stopping and won't run since last update	1
19111	It works perfectly after i complaining its error on airport authorities to give them my details which when i arrived in kuwait and my number and my location in kuwait After that they was send me notifications to register in this app on same number which i gave them to airport authorities and i was able to register within seconds (I REPEAT THOSE WHO SUFFERS FOR ERRORS CALL THE AIRPORT AUTHORITIES AND GIVE THEM YOUR FULL DETAILS THEY WILL FIX IT INSTANTLY	0

19118	Nice app with a good and clear user interface. Hopefully many will download and help to assist NI's contract tracing system. Ignore Jonathan S.'s troll review; this app uses the much more privacy focused decentralised model (compared to centralised model that people may have heard the UK were perusing some months ago). This means means that the data collected is very limited, and in fact, the app clearly lays out and explains what data is and isn't collected up-front. (Note to the developers: I'm not sure how the Google Play store search works, but I found this app very hard to find... In fact, I need to use a direct link. Searching all variations of "StopCOVID NI" only brought back the other HSC "COVIDCare" app, which could easily confuse people looking for this contact tracing app. Given that most downloads will be soon after initial release and announcement, I hope this is fixed soon for the sake of greater uptake.)	0
19119	The Data collected is encrypted and will only be stored on your phone and the other COVIDSafe User's Phone *clicks next* "Information about your use of COVIDSafe will be collected and stored on a highly secure server" "You may also ask for your information to be deleted from the secure server" Also given what i've read this app will be useless regardless since it only tracks if you are within 1.5m of someone for 15 minutes, which doesn't track who you really transfered Covid-19 to at all.	1
19120	Terrible on bluetooth service as other review mentioned, it occur huge battery consumtion (OnePlus5T, running service checked), internet service interfere and also wireless bluetooth headphones interfere.	1
19121	Watch your memory and data.	1
19122	Just updated. It asked for my NRIC details. Cannot proceed as it keeps saying validation failed for NRIC field. Please fix.	1

19128	Drains the battery especially when bluetooth is On, still prefer the safe entry application Instead.	1
19129	Waste battery	1
19130	The app is quick and easy to use. I am however 8 days waiting for someone to call me and inform me what day I was in contact with a covid positive. The self isolation continues as advised.	0

19133	CHANGE MANAGEMENT NETWORK OPERATORS and Ethiopia VPN connection etc	1

19135	My ID under the safe entry can be viewed in full without any authentication, feeling unsecured.	1
19136	No issues at all. Easy to jump on board... Other apps ask for much more information and require many more permissions. Let's get back to normal asap	0

19162	Worst app	1
19163	I turned on the apl all the time. But the bluetooth function on my mobile suddenly became faulty. I believe the tracetogether app consumes alot of power on bluettooth chip and bluetooth chip works 24\u00d77 without stopping , this caused the bluetooth chip broken down. I am not aware that BT chip is broken down and not aware the app has stopped. Please do optimization on the bluetooth function to consume lesser power when it is required to run all time.	1
19164	Thank you for implementing such a wonderful apps. You should keep option for downloading for old version mobile users. Like, a lots of peoples are leaving in Qatar, thouse are using very old model mobile phones. They are suffering now for their old phones, they do not have availability to buy a new phone and now they are not able to come out from their home for their urgency. We can make a option for SMS service system. How we are checking our mobile balance, in the same way you can implement.	0

So I am not sure if that's the reason I am not getting my OTP hence cannot create my account. Please fix it ASAP.

19273	Useless app, i got Permit for 40 minutes on first day of installing app, then always denied to issue permit for supplies within neighbourhood. Developers have to work on it to fix the problem.	1
19274	Not compatible with Huawei P40 Pro. Blocked on mobile number registration (when click on "get OTP" nothing happen)	1
19275	Bad, failed to upload 3 times with no proper inatruction!	1
19276	Very useful, convenient and easy to use. Especially for those places that you frequently go to like office, shopping mall, market, country clubs etc as you just to need to set as favorite.	0
19277	Appears to drain battery and made my phone unusually hot if it was sitting in my bag or on a material surface. I\u2019ve had to remove it from my phone.	1
19278	Never receive any notifications	1
19279	No good application \u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude14\u2639\ufe0f	1

19281	I am not able to login because my old mobile has damaged and I have change my mobile and I have only 1number that I am using please help it's urgent my company is not allowing me to come in office ðŸ˜¢ (my mobile name is samsungA51 And android version is 10. Please help ðŸ™�	0
19282	Battery drain seems to have been resolved on the Note 8. ????	1
19283	Partial	1
19284	Tried to register to use the app , couldnt get the 6 digit pin number then when i did get the pin nunber it told me the pin was wrong & said to cgeck my internet connection.	1
19285	It starts to reboot my phone after I open the app. I am using Android 11.	1
19286	downloaded the app from Google play store but failed setting it up as the app says I entered a invalid nric number. reinstalled multiple times and rechecking the nric number numerous times. Still failed.... can someone fix this?	1
19287	App won\u2019t accept a valid phone number when registering. Cannot use app at all.	1
19288	Very bad. Not updated and smooth data process. Data anytime motivated.	1
19289	This app is disrupt my bluetooth headphone connection! Playing music interrupt from time to time. And tis app is battery SUCKER. How you expect ppl use it at all time, if you draining their phone battery?	1
19290	Hi, I can't register my phone number. Stated as number not valid. I already contacted my provider Circle life, they said no issue at their end. *Update: Circle life said, your side need to update the google library. Please advice, thanks!	1
19291	I download the app yesterday,. Registration went fine. However, i received results of old test which was on april while my test result of 5th May didn't show.	1
19292	I realise it might not be your fault, more Google's permission issues but making me leave my location and Bluetooth on is a security risk I find unacceptable. Granted its not as bad as dying from a incurable disease so you get one star back.	1
19293	To all the people saying that they don't want to be 'tracked', that is just ridiculous. For one, you are already being tracked far more by services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram and via your SIM card. These companies legally have to forfeit data via a court order, so if you don't want to be tracked you will need to get rid of any piece of technology that uses internet. Not even a court order can release the data gathered by this app! If you want restrictions eased quicker, use this app.	1
19294	Took me 3 days to get out to download. Kept saying my phone number was wrong. Now that I have it, I turned Bluetooth on but it keeps flashing on and off. I've tried deleting app and reloading it several times. Does anyone have this problem?	1
19295	Not working	1
19296	Bad app harmful to device	1
19297	Dont know why need to input NRIC Date of issue... it is one of the madatory field if you want to reset SingPass password.	1
19298	1. There was like 1-2 seconds delayed during checking in/out comparing to SingPass SafeEntry check in(it is almost instant).\n\n2. Should have one group check in button to press instead of every time I have to press check in then press back again only can choose group check in. (Widget)\n\n3. Should have option to search for location as well. If you would like to says not to has location search is to ensure everyone appear on where they are then you should not have the  favourite.\n\nPlease refer to SingPass safe entry to adopt their functionality, they did a great app and widget.	1
19299	Keeps the country safe and let's us track our location history to ease contact tracing process. Hopefully Singapore will get through this crisis together!	0

19303	Good apps	0
19304	It tells me my phone number is invalid and I'm unable to locate any support resources that address this. Therefore I'm unable to register.	1

19307	+ Didn't really drain the battery so much as I expected + only need to upload if you are tested positive - kept resetting my phone multiple times after install (Android 5.1), runs much better on Android 7. + Scanning QR codes is quick + saving favorite QR	0
19308	Why do they need my storage and files access? Once when I deny access to storage app closes, which means I'm obligatory to give them access to my files in order to run the app. I would love to hear reason for invading our privacy!	1
19309	Overheat the battery almost destroyed phone. They say fault fixed I would not trust it again.	1
19310	Nice hope everyone grabs this app thank you for allowing all world regions to download unlike RC143.	0
19311	Complete privacy violation...	1
19312	I had written all my data right but I couldn't register yet. It is written Verification failed. Probably it has bugs	1
19313	Battery intensive	1
19314	2 days ago, i reinstalled the app because it was showing ? sign and i was reluctant to restart my phone again and again. After reinstalling, now its even parmanently showing "?" sign...I am frusterated... even i cannot enter into any shop, just because of the bugs in the app.	1
19315	No bluetooth exchange after a day please assist.	1
19316	Good initiative to aid contact tracing. However, bluetooth audio is disrupted and music playback will be interrupted every 10-15 seconds which is irritating. This is especially relevant in an office setting where users will be on Bluetooth earphones and where tracing is important. Please look into the issue if its resolvable. Battery drain is manageable on a Samsung Note 8.	1
19317	Great application	0
19318	There needs to be an option to change the language of UI	1
19319	Awesome	0
19320	It asks you to update and when I updated it, same message is there even if you click ok.	1
19321	Good	0
19322	Why do you need to know date of birth and date of issue of NRIC in order to use this app, if it's purpose is solely for tracing covid-19 contacts? Reply to app developer: Are you saying that the safe entry we have been using all these months are not effective, since it does not require the input of our date of birth?	1
19323	Why the actual hell would anyone download this?! Do not download this app, it allows the government to track your location!!! Jesus Christ, if anyone downloads this you and seriously dumb!	1

19328	Can't receive OTP, I tried thru App and website, no use, pls fix it.	1
19329	Poor accuracy	1
19330	Testing of this APP shows flaws. It will respond with "invalid phone number" if for whatever reason you need to register again. Simply deleting the cache causes the APP to fail. Only solution is to uninstal and download again. On one phone tested the APP looked like it was working but there was no Bluetooth activity so it was not. Something happened to the APP over night. The APP records every other phone with this APP installed, meters away through walls and in other apartments. I could go on	1
19331	The purpose of the app is good, but it does not display the current number of past and present cases. There are no declared cases by the LGU? I dont think so. Kindly look into this and keep it up developers. We can do this.	1

19335	Update: 20/12/20 Battery drainage is still terrible. Still can login multiple devices with one mobile number. 30/11/20 When I sign in the same number on a new phone, all my Favourites does not port over from the profile/account of the old phone, and all my saved Favourites are gone. And when I sign in the same mobile number on a new phone, the old phone does not auto sign out, meaning I could scan 2 or more different places at the same time, with the multiple same Profile/NRIC.	1

19379	Works well if not informatively, but had to uninstall when it rendered my Android Phone unusable with unbelievable battery consumption. Worse still did not show in statistics as using the power, thereby rendering phone unusable. Regrettably had to uninstall. Put it back when it was fixed and it was great for a while, them had another huge increase in battery consumption. I mistakenly blamed this app, as a logical move, but am upgrading rating as I was wrong and it was not the cause of my issue	0

19430	The idea is great, but still drains the battery even after reinstalling it after recent update.	1
19431	This stupid app does not work at all. I emailed and asked for help but still does not work. Apparently it would be my fault if I don't use this problematic app. Seriously guys... fix this if this is a mandatory app that you want people to use this for the Singapore's government sake.	1

19488	I feel the app is getting slower and slower each day updating the daily numbers. Also I can't understand why local numbers are always two days out of date when rte has already put out local numbers by 6.20 each day. The app was supposed to be all up to date to fight covid.	1

19498	Now this app became worst because after updating this app and when I opened it ask me information. After filling up all information I clicked on submit option and then it stucks...

19515	A red herring. App does not stay in background despite following instructions to give permissions on my Huawei P30. There has to be a better solution in such times	1
19516	My friend is unable to download the app on her Samsung android phone. Error message is cannot download in her country. She is in Singapore and her network provider is Singtel. How can this be resolved? Thanks.	1
19517	It kept telling me to update the app but the update option isnt available.	1
19518	Good idea but poorly designed. 1: Battery usage question and selection descriptions are ambiguous. 2: Should recognize stable "home" location and switch off Bluetooth until required by a change of geolocation or status. 3: Released prior to accepting registrations - dumb	1
19519	Well written app. Easy to use and register. Permissions requested make sense. Hopefully initiatives like this will speed our return to free movement.	0

19521	This is draining battery because it's tracking more than covid symptoms. Its reading everything in your phone. Spyware.	1
19522	A little disappointed. Downloaded the app on the first night it was released. On the third day after recharging my phone that morning, by the end of the day my phone went flat. Normally my phone's battery can last up to 2-3 days without recharging. So unfortuntely i had to uninstall the app because it was using up the battery life and i cannot keep my phone on charge during the day. Hoping this issue can be fixed.	1
19523	Can't open	1
19524	This app ruins listening to Spotify, it causes it to constantly cut out. From the reviews a lot of users are having this issue so please fix and update the app	1
19525	Good app	0
19526	Forced to install this app by my company. There's an annoying notification that stays on my notification bar forever. Drains battery like crazy, and after I installed it, keeps causing my bt to disconnect. Horrible app. Once again, I was FORCED to install this, maybe so some higher up can hit their kpi with the inflated number of downloads.	1
19527	Waste of time, show only error	1
19528	Why does this app need permission to 'make and manage phone calls'? Surely this is not required as it already has access to phone files, location and Bluetooth settings. I am concerned over privacy with any application which needs this permission.	1
19529	I couldn't even open the app. It doesn't work.. made me disappointed Edited- now it works thank you	1

19537	I can't start this application bcz it showing when iam add my mobile number ID number and exp. Date "error getting OTP, try again" so many times I tried this. unfortunately doesn't work. Finally I check all comments in play store , I saw more same complaint I can't find the solution. Kindly please replay any one for the solution.	1
19538	App isn\u2019t working - it tells me my details are not correct.it wont accept my phone number which is correct,	1
19539	Doesn't work, doesn't load	1
19540	This app uses a lot of power. It almost ended my full batt by noon. Not easy for me to integrate this into my 3+ years phone. I've Uninstalled it. Personally find this app redundant with all the safe entry and nric logs. Best protection is still physical protection.	1
19541	Worst app \ud83d\ude21	1
19542	Keep on interference my blue tooth devices Very annoying when connect to my sound bar Keep cut it off It would nice if this problem can be resolve Seen many comments about this	1

19548	This app not working i can't write date of birth.....	1
19549	Worked fine up until today. My Bluetooth is constantly on but it's not registering it and keeps asking me to connect. App is pretty much redundant now.	1
19550	I just want to ask how can i fix my ehteraz ..my Qatar id is expired and i need to use ehteraz in Airport ..i will go home for good.. but i cannot register now in ehteraz how many times i call 109..\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7aplease help.. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f i dont know what to do now..	1
19551	I used this for a while until I realised it was the cause of all my Bluetooth sound problems - it makes all my music playback via Bluetooth skip frequently for 1-8 secs or so. Uninstalled it and all is fine again. Edit: Developers response seems to be standard reply for everyone reporting this problem. What other details do they need?! There is apparently widespread BT interference in this app that uses BT scanning. Happening on all our latest Samsung phones, Android 10.	1
19552	Works. Easy to download and register	0
19553	From 70 % battery to 23% in less than 2 hours and I've not even been using my phone.. no way u should download the app unless u want it connected to ur charger all day.	1

19566	Keep on crashing after last updatem uninstall then reinstall, still the same. Restart phone...still the same... fix please...draining battery	1
19567	The app shows a question mark and I have tried everything that you have mentioned including reinstalling the app and clearing data and cache. Been trying to call 109 for the last 4 days, but no one has called back. Please help urgently.	1
19568	Awesome App. I think it help us to remove corona	0
19569	Battery use it still quite extensive. However on a side note, if mobile network signal is bad or down, the app might not be able to connect to read and register the qr code right? Will there be a TT qr code in the app similar to the token for the personnel at the venue to scan?	1
19570	I was happy to install and with functionality however this drained my battery, about 10% every 90mins, just sitting in my bag. Had to uninstall for this reason.	1
19571	Fantastic app wish everyone will download and install it to make Australia safer \ud83d\ude0a	0
19572	Hi there ... it's an offence if the Bluetooth is off when using this apps, due battery flat or Other apps Battery saver automatically off the Bluetooth. It's MUST on the Bluetooth 24hrs.??? I still not clear how it work and what the purpose to use it.	1
19573	not allowing signing up	1
19574	I had no trouble installing the app and recommend everybody doing it. BUT it isn't compatible with my wife's Samsung running Android 5.1.1. I'll bet there are millions of people in that position. Unless the app is capable of working on those phones there's not much chance of us reaching the number of installs required by the Govt.	1
19575	I fill in information but system say wrong information	1
19576	Nice app, very helpfully	0

19580	Not effective and drains battery	1
19581	Your apps is not working? Cant giv 0 star? Why is need to turn on bluetooth that will flat off our battery. After turn on bluetooth it still show "your apps is not working" even multiple exit has been performed. Wasted time. Its the worst QR apps that i have used. Already un-istalled it. Will use IC for entry tracker for some placed that insist of using Tracetogether apps.	1
19582	Super aap	0
19583	It should be able to link to singpass during setup instead of having to make me look for my nric for issue date.	1
19584	Terrible. I got to send money and the app had a question mark. A waste of uber. Called customer service and it's still not working.	1
19585	Very good app it is like bodyguard I used arogya setu app when my mother was ill and it helped me with direct consultancy of doctors but after someday that feature had gone we all need that feature again	0
19586	Nice	0
19587	Why showing (?) again. Many times uninstall & reinstalled again n again, same problem. What to do.pls advise me.	1
19588	I believe this is a good way to track people....but its alot of battery load on my phone. You can make it appear more user "friendly", as it is just tracking people all the time even when there home. People can feel safe if You guys can add an option called going out, where the bluetooth and tracking starts and not all the time and switch it off at home.	1
19589	Inhibits connectivity with other bluetooth devices	1
19590	Why this app needs root permission? I didn't see any explanation about it in the terms of use page.	1
19591	Had to delete the App because my phone was discharging very fast & the screen was so hot afew times that I thought the phone was going to explode !!!	1
19592	Lousy app. Can't even register	1
19593	Needs to be improved: The app after activating it puts a permanent notification on the phone and if I remove it, the app stops tracking. Also, the app does NOT work with the official Google Api (exposure notifications). Please enable integration ASAP. This way we make sure exposure tracking and notification is secure, private and reliable.	1

19602	After the new update the app asks for registration again and gives error, " could not get API key" . Please support	1
19603	Easy to use. Hope everyone downloads It. \n\nMessage for the developers: Send a push notification whenever Bluetooth is disabled advising users that the app will not properly operate if Bluetooth is disabled!	0
19604	Slow, constantly getting stuck, results don't show up. Unacceptable as it's probably one of the most important apps as of now.	1

19635	I downloaded after the latest update. Whenever I enter my NRIC details, a message comes - " Temporarily unavailable please try again later" I don't know how to fix it because without the details the app doesn't scan.	1
19636	My phone battery is draining really fast since installing this. Have to recharge at least twice during the day with normal use. Plus my phone is running hot all the time.	1
19637	Imagine forcing us to keep bluetooth on.. AND FORCED PUSH NOTIFICATION WOW	1
19638	Seems fine.	0
19639	After successfully done the setup, the next time I checked on it, it show "setup is incomplete!". Already done setup a few times, still the same issue	1
19640	App version 2.3.8. Android 10 oneplus 7 pro Recently the app battery drain is insane, it's the top battery consumption app. Badly optimised, please investigate, else rollback to a previous stable version it's quite irritating	1
19641	Not even opening after download	1
19642	I don't understand how such an app is made mandatory. It should be tested before being a recommendation. It drains my battery so much. I've even tested it on both android and iphone and both battery utilization is bad. The app causes lots of frustration. I rather scan my IC then use this app.	1
19643	After clearing the cache, reinstalled the app several times and going on trying to activate, atlast I got the message 'Exceeded number of activation' please contact 109. Busy, many on the line, will call back in 2 hours, this is the usual reply every time. I don't know what to do now. I need to go hospital and other places. But I don't know how it is possible without this app.	1
19644	Can not sign up or sign in	1
19645	The bluetooth wasnt working on this app, I dont know how I can use this.	1

19651	Great apps?	0
19652	It just says no. Invalid	1
19653	Good job	0
19654	Useless. Battery optimisation disables app, even after following developer instructions. This is a global pandemic, get your act together or let someone else step up! Now says abornmal power consumption. Get ur act together!	1
19655	the app said if I'm a foreigner i have to use my passport number to get my hes code. and i did. when i tried to book a bus seat (using my residence permit id), it said hes code doesn't match the tc number i used. so i go back to the app to replace my passport number with my tc number, and there's no way to do it! you can't log out, you can't change the id associated with your telephone number, and i now I'm stuck because of this!	1
19656	It's the best application that I saw ever. The motive of the app is excellent. It will alert us if we are suspected or not as we will pass by or contact by a covid effected person. So by that we can go for self quarantine or go for a medical checkup. It will help us and will protect others also. The only issue by this app is the drain of the battery. It's is consuming toomuch battery charge. Just only try to fix it.	0
19657	Bluetooth location won't stay on Oppo A2020 and the app doesn't ask for always allowing Bluetooth location access. So when it stops running in the foreground it's particularly useless.	1
19658	26th 06 2020 now aap was not working why?	1
19659	Evidently, governing authorities have not set this up to work in Alberta. Nice idea. But fails to execute. Shame given how much this technology really could aid the containment.	1
19660	Great initiative to track down potential cluster cases. Please download it to protect everyone and let us get back to our normal life sooner.	0

19669	Very low quality app. ??????	1
19670	Our Bluetooth can start automatically every time we restart our mobile. It seems that this app needs to be manually started. It's hard to remember to do this. Can it be made to auto restart too?	1
19671	Yes it installs on 5.1 now but gets stuck after enabling Bluetooth. Proceed does not enable battery optimisation off and Bluetooth location. Oppo R7+ with ColorOs. The new version starts bu reports not connected to internet while the phone is connected to internet. App 'report problem' fails. Is it of any use without Internet?	1
19672	Only starting to use it	1
19673	Draining battery.	1
19674	After reinstalling, feeding the correct data, tried to get yhe verification pin but in vain, tried more than 30 times in the last 3hrs, no use, called technical team, only 6 people in waiting, cannot answer, poor customer service, said will take 2hrs to attend, overall getting irritation and frustrated.	1
19675	Terrible interface, horrible app optimisation and saps a ton of RAM.	1
19676	Nice	0
19677	good	0
19678	Unable to even register with the app,after its installed when you open the app for registration only a blank screen is visible. Few minutes later it shows "an error has occurred, please try again later or contact customer support".	1
19679	Good	0
19680	App interferes with other bluetooth devices like my ear buds. The disruption is pretty bad where it distorts my music every few secs. My ear buds works perfectly and everything goes back to normal once I pause the app.	1
19681	A pain in the ass to register. Why make it so unfriendly!!!	1

19692	The latest update is smashing my battery. Until recently the app barely registered in terms of battery consumption but the latest update has it at the top for battery consumption. Given that the efficacy of the app is near to pointless, I'm tempted to remove this app and rely on Google maps tracking instead.	1
19693	Was notified today,11th May ,that i was near a coronavirus patient on the 27th April at a certain place and time.Am i now having to isolate even though 14 days have gone by and i have no symptoms?Why the delay in notifying me?	1

19706	Setup is easy. However, my fitbit seems to stop syncing after setting this up. Does the bluetooth blocks off other devices?	1

19725	Is best	0
19726	For me the main point of using this app was radius alert but it isn't showing correct records. Few days ago there were lot of pins and now it has changed. its almost changing on daily basis. This need to be fixed as the radius alert was the game changer otherwise there is government website to check for figures and updates.	1
19727	My app hang why	1
19728	Useless	1
19729	Everytime I try to sign into the app it says that it is "Temporarily unavailable" and that "We're really sorry. Please try again later." I have tried many times and yet the same thing shows up.	1

19737	Contact Tracing and early warning are a very important aspect in controlling COVID19, but making an app that is not very efficient like EHTERAZ is not really helping all people, esp imposing huge fine and jail time, it creates anxiety and panic to those having lower version of phone and having trouble with OTP request during sign up. Please have you technical staff replaced by more competent personnel. Thank you.	1
19738	Use too much battery life I am just at home and it had 89% since morning and only use it for 30 mins max Once its night tine and i want to play Its on 30%	1

19747	Worked well. Then after a month got the battery draining error but that's fixed now. No longer draining battery.	1
19748	COVID-19 has nearly been around for a year now and the app is still not able to be used in all provinces. If reporting is not able to be done in the app in all provinces, why use “Canada” in the app name? More importantly, why have it on our phones if it’s proprietary to only certain provincial needs?	1
19749	There is a bug in the app. It says my Nric is invalid	1

19797	Useless	1
19798	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

19813	Do you really need a 10 digit password? After unsuccessfully attempting 3 times I gave up. Post message. Thanks for your response, however, a 10 digit password is near impossible for someone who has mild Dyslexia. This problem has not been considered. I won’t be downloading a 10 digit password app	1

19816	Seem working again .. thank you	0
19817	This latest version is definitely a much improved version. The downside is still the drain on the battery life. Also is there any plan to incorporate the scanning of QR code? It's nice to have the barcode for scanning but scanning of QR code can be much easier and faster instead.	1
19818	Very helpful to us especially in this time of pandemic.	0
19819	Not helpful at all!!! Not reliable because the confirm cases declared by lfu is always 0 ..... So meaning no cases of covid anywhere? And it always need an update (app) very annoying but no difference at all!! I think it's a trap bec if you put your health status and it's not in good condition? I think I think they will put you as probable .... Uninstall this app ...and never download it again!	1
19820	Not receiving any otp. Tried both my Globe and Smart, still not receiving one.	1
19821	It's a decent app. I hope it works in helping people and not doing other things.	0
19822	The idea for this apps was great...only the problem is it easy drain the battery of my phone	0
19823	Causes bluetooth problems. I am quite happy to do my bit to track and stay safe but the bluetooth problems are frustrating	1
19824	Good	0
19825	Glad this is open source, uses Bluetooth (no active tracking or data usage). No privacy data is tracked or used in the app - Ontario is taking the right step!	0

19830	Not working	1
19831	Before the update there was no notification about the device and the application was running normally. But, after several updates, a notification appears, "your device has been detected as having root access" while the device has never been and is not in the rooted state even though there was no notification before and now the application cannot be opened and used.	1

19838	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

19897	Doubtful it works, it only does a check when you go in and prompt it, I had zero checks for 14 days on a few occasions. I have the app on 3 devices in the same house and they have never had a handshake with each other.	1
19898	Why this app atumaticly throw out I can't undstand plz do something	1

19922	The idea is great but the execution...this has got to be one of the worst government funded apps ever. Terrible for the battery, constant errors, intrusive to a dangerous degree and I don't believe that it's secure with our data. All these resources and THIS is the best they could develop? Hire better coders and have a rethink about how to approach this issue.	0
19923	Good app	0
19924	Uses way too much battery for the function it is trying to achieve. Awarding 1 Star for effort, 0 stars for the app. The app is so bad at battery efficiency even after so many months since it's original release, it makes one kind of look forward to carrying the turd of a trace together device instead.	1
19925	Good Apps	0
19926	super easy setup process, after which it's pretty much "set it and forget it". No excessive permissions required. Doesn't seem to affect my battery life much.	0

19928	Great initiative and no battery drain so far. For all those people that go on about privacy and it is surveillance and the government tracking people, just have a think. This is installing on a Google phone and Google know far more about you, where you go, places you visit and the speed you go to get there. They know they sites you visit, when you visit and it all links up with your behaviour. This app does not do that. Just a simple Bluetooth register on your phone and upload if you get ask	0

19933	While the app has privacy covered for use with location services other apps don\u2019t. Also the battery life is now reduced. This is why I don\u2019t use location services. Now my app won\u2019t work. Not happy.	1

19939	The app is simple and convenient to use - but over the last 24 hours it has alerted me about the same potential overlap 14 times! Besides being annoying, this lowers the seriousness of receiving such an alert	0
19940	Service not available Can't login to the app	1
19941	A perfect balance between safety and privacy, huge props to the team involved. \n\nOne thing that should be made more clear: if you restart your phone you need to relaunch the app to enable exposure tracking again. My tracking history shows a 3 day gap because of this.	0
19942	Test Results unavailable even I have done test 4 times.	1

Need to keep restarting my phone in order for my other BT devices to be able to be detected by the phone again. The app notification is really annoying. Everytime the notification pops up, my other BT devices got disconnected. Not everyone in SG owns a brand new phone. Be mindful when creating an app for the nation	1

19974	Storing the encryption key(s) with the data seems crazy?

19975	Easy to use. Take less than a min to setup and u are ready to play a part with our social responsibilty to keep covid19 at bay.

20017	the idea and intiative is very good but it consumes too much battery power and it makes the phone slower. also if i may suggest if there is a map and indicate by location the hotspots in order to avoid going to those areas. additionally, if i am home then turned off the app, the app just keeps on popping on the background and enabling the bluetooth, it says we can only turn on the app while going outside. maybe there will be additional settings for us people to customize the control of this app.	0

20087	I have an Oppo phone. The app is constantly turning itself off, multiple times a day. Making it unreliable. It interferes with my other blue tooth connections. Have uninstalled & reinstalled a few times, but no improvement. The idea of it is good, the function of it isn't. Very disappointing.	1
20088	Needs to be fixed ASAP. The app always says my credentials are wrong and tells me I have to log out and register with a number that ends with 788 which is not my phone number!! Also why is Bluetooth mandatory to use this app? This just drains battery for no reason	1
20089	Always get error verifying my phone number... tried uninstall and install this app a few times and still get same error!... no help button unable to ask for help.	1

20106	Broken notification - Currently showing notification "COVIDSafe is not active" but tapping notification opens app and it says "COVIDSafe is active. No further action is required". Hopefully it really is working. Might be useful, but can't be sure. I've installed this app and so far haven't got Covid 19 (that I know of). Registration was easy, and can be done using a pseudonym. Battery usage is quite low.	1

20135	I use a galaxy 9 and I can't use this app as it turns my Bluetooth off completely, which makes the app useless as it requires Bluetooth to work. I have now downloaded and installed 3 times. Let's hope at some point it will begin to work.	1
20136	After updating to the latest version (red app icon) the following functions totally crashes the app: The barcode icon on top right and the SafeEntry. Once you clicked on either of this the app will just crash and exit itself.	1

20141	5/9/20 update: for a few weeks been thinking my Bluetooth speakers were broken . Then I realised its the covid safe app using the Bluetooth interfering with the signal. Uninstalled the covid safe app and speakers working fine again. I pay $12 a month for spotify and not going to have the covid safe app ruin my music streaming. Would be good if I could turn the covid safe app off when at home and still have Bluetooth on for my speakers. Let me know if I can as I have uninstalled the app.	1

20223	This app cripples push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp. After turning on TraceTogether, other apps does not receive push notifications until you open them. In addition, with TraceTogether running, my phone is unable to download or update any apps from playstore. The download/update will be stucked at 100% without installing them. Only way to make it work again is to force stop TraceTogether, restart phone then updates other apps.	1

Problem seems to be my Malwarebytes anti malware protection which may perceive this COVIDsafe app as a malware threat and attack it. I want both Malwarebytes and COVIDSafe to continue as good apps to have. Can a way be found for them to coexist on my mobile phone at same time?	1

20275	The app as a serious problem...After updating the app it's not responding(automatically closing) called 109 several times the line remains busy and getting auto reply as agent call u by 2hrs....It's been 3 days still the issue not fixed	1
20276	Well done HSC, the cooperation on the island to get a Northern Ireland Covid tracker app up and running has been fantastic work, and the interoperability of the underlying platforms both here and across Europe is a great move. The app willconnect to the Google Covid tracking service that runs constantly in the background, and reconnects to that constantly running service to check keys a few seconds after being launched. This is why it takes a few seconds on launch to confirm tracking is active.	0
20277	Good	0
20278	At first the app seemed to work fine. Later, the issue with battery saving and checks not happening rose. Now, the app refuses to even start regardless of my fixing attempts and rebooting. Unfortunately this makes the app useless to me. My phone is a 5 years old Huawei.	0
20279	I logged the code from my phone with my doctor when I had the test. I tested positive, got the results via my doctor but the app still says "test result not yet available'. Therefore no contact tracing was achieved via the app. This was almost 2 weeks ago now. Hopefully these issues will be solved soon especially for future interoperability with other apps within the EU.	1
20280	Works as advertised, now using Exposure notification API from Google Services, doesn't drain battery much and is generally easy and safe to use. There is a weekly notification with number of checks for potential exposure to verify it is working.	0

20296	It is a good app. My phone did not slow down its perfonmance. I will trust the goverment on this. If they fail us they will certainly pay. The app needs a "turn off" button as I don't need it running in the background when stayin at home.	0

20332	First, I tried in my I phone 5S and it's not installing. It's need IOS 3.0 and above and I can't update my phone now as it's already updated (12.4.6) as per Apple. To do update IOS 3.0 Apple need to provide the updation. Second, I have tried in my another phone ; Redmi note 3. It's installed but during the time for acceptance of terms and privacy page, it's getting off and showing "Unfortunately Ehteraz stop working". Please advice what shall I do.	1

20334	Not working good.	1
20335	Well good app	0
20336	Simple and straightforward, does what it needs to do, nothing more or less. Multiple independent reports indicate that privacy is adequately protected.	0
20337	Same as below. Battery started draining this weekend. I uninstalled this app and problem solved. Developer needs to find a fix and publicise or the whole purpose of app will be defeated as more people uninstall.	1
20338	A necessary app at this time that doesn't work correctly. Always crashing, I'm having to uninstall and the reinstall. Phone call to help desk was helpful but I'm not going to call every time the App crashes. I have this app so I can go to work, and it has nearly stopped already for being able to enter work and the one time I go to the supermarket after weeks of not doing so!	1

20345	I had waited my OTP for so long. And yes, it will never arrived, bruh. Uninstalled this application for good. Good bye and have a nice #DiRumahAja day!	1
20346	Causes major connectivity issues with my Bluetooth devices, constantly makes my head phones and fitbit conect and reconnect at some points getting so bad (even when no one else is around) that i had to turn off the app. Also not a fan of the notification doesnt really need to be there constantly to do it job the app is doing that.	1
20347	Useless i can't get my otp really really useless	1
20348	For what is worth, my Samsung phone is showing that the app has been operating in the background for 12 hours, zero minutes active, but used over 12% battery. I've only been out once to an un-crowded local supermarket (no one else at home). The app's never been like this before. I'll need to shut it until this battery demand situation changes.	1

20368	Very helpful app, Thanks a lot	0
20369	Gud	0
20370	Pretty good that it now combines history of QR scan and Bluetooth exchanges. however, I keep seeing a notification ("1") beside my app in my home screen but when I open it, I don't see anything. how do I resolve that?	0
20371	Keeps demanding I activate it when it is already on. I cannot delete the notice. Notice does not disappear when you click through to app. This is the sort of bug that will lead to people deleting the app. Annoying that I have to write this.	1
20372	Won't except my mobile no	1
20373	Bad	1
20374	When i will update this app after that it's not opening. it's coming only white on my screen	1
20375	Excellent apps	0
20376	Unnecessary thing but using forcefully	1
20377	Stupid that the app has to be used to enter for bank exams. What if someone gets exposed and was not carrying the phone?? Stupid idea	1
20378	Afghanistan phone number is not in this list \ud83d\ude01	1
20379	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
20380	Uses a ton of battery and has 2 constant notifications. If you are home all day why use location and battery 24/7?	1

20389	Drains phone battery. Used to be able to last the whole day on one charge, now I need to bring a power bank out every time	1
20390	Very frustrating to download as could not register. Stuck at message "invalid phone number". After much searching found a suggestion to turn on data instead of WiFi, which worked. Needs more guidance on the app or help page	1
20391	Wanted to use this but had to uninstall due to battery drain....40% in 2 hours	1
20392	It's great	0
20393	I am happy to download the app if it helps keep the virus in check and allows the government to relax restrictions.	0
20394	Stopped detecting other phones with the app installed. But the SafeEntry function works well.	1
20395	After the July update, it asked for location permission. What's going on?	1
20396	Very useful app and needed during current times but it was draining my battery. I usually get 1 to 2 days from my battery but i had to charge my phone 4 times in 1 day because of this app. I had to uninstall, i hope this is rectified soon so that i can install the app again later on.	0
20397	Large increase in battery usage after 18th December 2020 update.	1
20398	Very nice	0
20399	This app cannot work in Huawei P40 Pro with does not has Google Play support. Able to install, but cannot get the OTP after key in mobile number. Please look into this case urgently as government request all of us to use this Trace Togther app in public area by end of this year.	1
20400	Great idea but is causing bluetooth issues when streaming music to headphones. Audio constantly cuts out since installing app on Samsung S9. Bluetooth audio issue was fixed once app was deleted.	0

20431	Congrats, the latest update completely glitches the displaying of all lockscreen notifications, rendering them unreadable. Thankfully I can simply disable the CovidSafe notification from appearing altogether, though this obviously defeats its purpose. Galaxy S9, Android 10.	0

20433	QR code scan missing.	1
20434	Currently, this only works for those of us with a telco subscription.

Pls offer this in Chinese too.	1

20438	I have been trying to activate the app it keeps indicating that my id card is expired of which it's not..it's draining my phone battery and it's over heating..plus why does it need access to other unrelated apps in my device which is private??	1
20439	Not working	1
20440	Not a review but a suggestion to Australian govt. Every state has a QR app. Why not leverage this app by including a QR code reader to standardise QR codes across Australia	1
20441	Needs more info of how to benefit...not clear at all , only shows your face ID if negative or positive , doesn't show if others are threat to you because not clear if bluetooth of others need to be open or not. I hope more clear information to be more helpful application.	1
20442	Not able to send selfie	1
20443	Drains the battery and interferes with other Bluetooth connections (e.g. headphones/speaker constantly cuts in and out as this app scans for other devices). Would be better if this app could be put to sleep manually when not needed, like when at home. I'll give it a bit longer to see if you resolve it, but will need to delete the app if it doesn't improve...	1

20448	Simple to use, however when one clear or kill apps, this app is killed too as it is not a locked app (can manual set). Also, this app is also not a auto start app on reboot, again one can manually set it. Concerns, can this App allow communication between iPhone and Andriod Bluetooth? In the older iPhone it can't, now not sure didn't try. If can't comm between the 2 platforms then it is a big gap for this App. Also can iPhone ver of this App run in background, if not, it's another gap	0
20449	Force me to install, and the scan QR code function is not working at all	1
20450	Finally - great work! Now we just need to support our Government.	0

20472	I was unable to complete installation while using my phone to download the app. It wanted to send me a PIN to verify my details, but I had to exit the app to view the message and get the PIN. On attempting to return to the download, I had to start again from scratch.Swiping on my phone did nothing to help me.	1
20473	Updated 2 days ago & completed profile for set-up but repeatedly gets message to retry because there seems to be an internet connection issue. None from my end as I have wifi & bluetooth on. Looks like app now not running on my Samsung phone.	1

20476	Would be handly if you could set up a daily notification to remind you to check in. I usually dismiss drop down notifications if not urgent. It also crashed mulitiple times today when trying to open it and I had to re-install.	1
20477	My work means contact for 3 to 5 minutes at most so this app is no good for retail workers.	1

20487	Previously I tried using to do group check in at one venue but there's error. Tried another time at another venue and it works without hassle! Good job team! Since many of us always forget to check out, maybe consider having a simple timer notification to remind us to check out.	0
20488	Easy to set up. I work in retail and want to be able to be notified if there is someone in the vicinity with the virus so I can take additional precautions. Hopefully enough people will sign up so further travel restrictions can be eased	0
20489	Still dont work on Huawei P40 Pro	1
20490	How many times i tried but always temporary unavailable..	1
20491	In phone settings I needed to setup a custom power profile to enable this app to run in the background. Otherwise the app will stop due to the phones default power saving profile. It didn't restart automatically. It didnt restart if I rebooted the phone. App info says "There is nothing else to do except leave the app running and keep Bluetooth on. In fact you need to configure the phones power setting for a custom power profile and allow app to run in the background. Oppo Reno2 Z Colour OS V6.1	1

20528	Ineffective. It takes only a few seconds to become infected, but this app takes minutes before it register a contact. The idea is good but, the implementation is not a functional tracker.	1

20530	Not open source, so still a doubtful app. But unusual times, calls for unusual measures. Edit... I stand corrected! Thanks, and will definitely going to take a look at this on Git.	0

20533	Battery went from 100% to zero in 5 hours with not much use. I usually get a full day out of it.	1

20551	This isn't working anymore after a series of install and re-install a QUESTION MARK only shows in the status. Information should be circulated for this event as it will create confusion of whether or not we are allowed to go to work or to buy food stuffs outside.	1
20552	No notification of any one with Covid around you. It does not function as it suppose to.	1
20553	Installed months ago. Encountered some problems, tried to uninstall and reinstall. However, it doesn't allow a reinstall - possibly because my mobile number has already been registered. Disappointing that this should be the case. Worse, there is no provision to provide feedback that I can see. MDRao	1
20554	Drained my battery twice in a day , even whilst connected to a charger . Only help was to uninstall .	1
20555	Great initiative. One little thing I've noticed is normally when I loose our house wifi signal the phone goes to mobile data. When I'm back in range the wifi auto connects again. Twice today this auto reconnect hasn't happened. Not sure if it's the covid app or something else. Motorola 5gs phone.	0

20589	Alright, after rectification with the CSOs, the issue has been resolved. A suggestion would be to add a button for a camera scan where automatic *Check In/Out* occurs on camera scan. This is mostly for the older demographics who uses smartphones but are less literate. This autonomous check in/out only requires them to scan the QR code where they can also choose to tap to show the existing NRIC. Better to have more option for them.	1

20619	Happy	0
20620	This app uses a lot of power. It almost ended my full batt by noon. Not easy for me to integrate this into my 3+ years phone. I've Uninstalled it. Personally find this app redundant with all the safe entry and nric logs. Best protection is still physical protection.	1

20627	Simple to set up, runs in the background. Once it's set up you can forget about it. It will warn you if you've been in contact with someone.	0
20628	Excellent	0
20629	Why this app wants to access my photos and media and phone? I am accepting the location only. Its not working unless i will accept everything and this is not logic for me. So i will not use it unless it will be respecting my privacy. Thank u	1
20630	No problems. It's for protecting my own safety as well as family and friends. I hope they care enough to do the same for me.	0
20631	This app controls when I go out. When covid cases/deaths go up, I don't go out, or I change to a time when the crowds are smaller.	0

20649	Stuck at filling in our IC particulars. Always have error. Despite filling all details according to IC. Still telling us verification failed. Check all field. You should check on your end. If still having bug and not ready, dont force people to use this app.	1
20650	Thankful to be living in Australia and for this amazing app which will protect me, my family and my community. It runs in the background and you barely know it's running whilst it doing all the hardwork to keep us all safe\ud83d\ude0a	0

20659	App not working. Did not receive otp. Resend so many times	1
20660	Nice	0
20661	Works well except for yes, newer bluetooth transmissions will interfere with app getting location signals. Example: a colleague sends me a document at work through Bluetooth because there is no WiFi or email in the cold freezer. That doc will interrupt and cancel location-tracing signals. In other words, it is not foolproof. Will govt arrest those who switch off their Bluetooth? What abt those working from home in essential services? This does not allow me to give a fuller review.	1

20667	I'm sure it's a great app but I cannot complete the registration process. I left it to now in case they had traffic / capacity problems which would have been understandable. The app returned an invalid number error message each time I input my mobile number this evening - and I have tried more than 20 times - with and without the leading zero! And yes I have had my partner check I didn't get the number wrong. Hopefully a CovidSafe support tech can provide advise/solution. .	0

20669	working fine.... everything is fixed in the latest update.... hope this will help in identifying the actual/suspected COVID-19 cases more promptly	0

20677	Not working	1
20678	Works fine, easy to register. Everyone who is saying it didn\u2019t work it was because it wasn\u2019t going \u201clive\u201d to enter your mobile number until 6pm EST.	0
20679	I can't even get in I gave all the correct data even the OTP I put was correct but they say it was wrong!\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c I reinstall it same problem.	1
20680	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
20681	Good job	0
20682	Date of birth box in not functioning properly.	1
20683	After a Coronalert update my 3 years old €600 Android 9 smartphone stopped being supported by the app. The device was incompatible says Google Play store. No concrete feedback, no reaction from the developer's! This is unacceptable!	1
20684	I keep telling everyone I know to download it. \nFor the most part everyone is easy going with it and do their part to help track this and keep people safe. \nUnfortunately you get the odd person who’s just so ignorant and refuses to download it to be “different.” *sigh*\nOh right - the app - ingenious and simple. Love this.	0
20685	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
20686	Downloaded tried to enter code would not work with numbers. Went out and back in got sent 6 new codes no won’t let me enter a code. Can’t even rate it as it won’t work.	1
20687	Very bad Application and contains Many issues And there is no privacy as it always ask me to manage my photos and contacts	1
20688	Good	0
20689	The pause function is good. But only 3 choices on the duration If can improve or revamp to this part, i think the take ip rate will be even better. As majority are still encourage to Work from Home ( WFH), so the app is useful only when we step out of our home, and should be turn off when we are home. Dont your agree? So can consider having a simpler "turn on/ turn off button".. And just remind user when we go out, turn it on, just like we put on mask only when we go out of house.. Cheers	1
20690	Keeps cutting off my bluetooth earphone	1
20691	Great idea being that I am on chemo but would be better if I didn't drain my battery kinda need it for calls and texts. I found my phone battery did not last and since I uninstalled the app my phone charger faster and my battery lasts longer. But I wont reinstall my phone is brand new and not burning it out by having this I stick to comin seance keeping my hands clean and wearing a mask in crowed areas	1
20692	Verry good working	0
20693	After 24 may update app works no more and crashes every time i try to open	1
20694	I cannot even use the app always says sorry temporary unavailable I check all my details it's correct but always display the same thing.. Please check.. Hi I already emailed.. Just waiting for it..	1
20695	Fantastic app, can literally save lifes. Maybe yours?	0
20696	Got logged out overnight I assume from app update or some other backend update. You’re going to lose usage of the app this way.	1
20697	I've just downloaded the app and so far so good. All the features are very simplified to make it easy for all levels of our demographic to use it. One piece of feedback is to change the wording in the daily check in feature. You can choose one of the 2 options: "I'm good, no symptoms" and "I am not feeling well today". What if you have symptoms but are feeling ok? Ex. Having a continuous cough and some sore throat but otherwise feeling great? The app should collect more granular data.	1
20698	Liking all the extra information on the app recently	0
20699	From 5  to 1 Coronalert BE app is *no longer compatible  with (e.g.!) Sony Xperia running Android 9... Is it a new policy to *decrease* the adoption of and support for the Coronalert BE app?	1
20700	useless app	1
20701	Awesome and very helpful app	0
20702	The App is draining my phone's battery. I don't have a provision to charge it on the move, and coz of this i am finding my phone discharged and turned off almost every day... please rectify the issue ASAP... And also the app needs some permissions to access my storage and calls.. could you please explain why is that?	1
20703	Not one single case identified, what is the point in having it on all the time then.	1
20704	Good	0
20705	Battery drain for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 on most recent updates. I almost bought a new phone until I saw the posts on boards.ie. it could be a Google play issue or covid app issue.	1
20706	Nothing tells me how this app will alert me or what an alert looks or sounds like through my smart phone, when or if I come into contact with someone "registered as a Covid 19" person. An Extremely ambiguous app that doesn't make sense as far as explanation around it's practicality.	1
20707	Too complicated..if last effort of 5 attempts failed again I would not have registered. Surely there is a version of no more than one page-- Who needs a PIN when name, age range AND phone number has been supplied. I predict this Govt initiative will not reach it's target number and will I be a waste of time. What's the adage...."Write for your reader!.."......KISS principle! Good luck. John. PS where's the SEND icon for this message!!!! I give up. Oh I had to hit one of the Stars!!!	1
20708	Not very valid and applicable app	1

20710	Good premise... But since installing my phone has slowed right down. Cuts out other apps and disrupts Bluetooth connections with other devices.	0
20711	Easy to install, easy to register. If it help us get back to normal quicker, I'm all for it. They are very clear as to how the data is kept and when it will be accessed	0
20712	Issue about bluetooth. I'm starting to see issues about my bluetooth devices cutting out and even dropping connections sometimes. Battery usage has slighty increased. Other than these issues, everything is fine and would you bring dark mode back? Edit: Bluetooth connectivity of my devices are having intermittent drops here and there. No improvement for bluetooth stability at all. Each update is getting worse	1
20713	It's good	0
20714	Constantly shows connected to null and disconnected to null pop ups on my phone screen Samsung s10. Super annoying. So I uninstalled it and have only reinstalled it cos we needed to travel for medical appointment.	1

20724	I can't register, it says that password doesn't meet the requirements, but in fact I already followed all the rules for putting the password	1
20725	What is the point of the app if you can pause it. Does not make any sense. Manipulate the numbers seems to be the real reason.	1
20726	Downloaded latest update. Now lost all data and can’t scan or make manual entries. Called help. Logged out. Re booted phone and logged back in. Same problem. Hopeless! Not sure why I bothered.\nEnded up having to delete existing app and start again. Hopefully all previous data not required. Like this government. Hopeless!\nInterestingly no developer response to date.	1

U load it up and google play store will inform all users there's a new update.... why do the double job?	1

20823	Can't use it because I'm in the US.	1
20824	Good improvement. You should also enable view pass and selectively check out those passes. There are multiple check-in at the same time and currently it only records the lastest pass. The person is still in the building..	1

20840	The app is ok I guess, but it took 5 days until it showed up I had contact with a positive case (my brother). Way tooo long. May not be the app, but it took 4 days alone that he got the key to put in the app... Cool idea but not useful if it fails at human again...	1

20847	App is useful for contact tracing. However, why do you not allow group check in yet make the function available. Please make this available when you are bringing babies to the polyclinic yet you need physical ID to scan in. This is increasing touch point which is defeats the original idea of reducing touch point	1

20857	The Iranian government does not help and makes medicine more expensive every day, and no bread can be found. The mask was collected from pharmacies in the early days of the Corona to be sold at high prices due to high demand. Why does Corona not kill from China?	1
20858	OTP Problem resolved and app access without further issue	1
20859	I can't even register! Keep on showing validation failed after I entered my NRIC! I uninstall and tried again but still failed!	1
20860	Nothing wrong with oppo phones. Your oppo is protecting your information and phone processes. This app is invasive and shouldn't rely on 24/7 access. Taking the QR code photo should be suffice. Seems like the government doesn't trust us to do the right thing.	1

20864	I have asked why my covid test result still not available where in I had my result november 15. Upon registration you need to put the emitates ID and the phone number provided in test center! When i successfully registered I received an error show that my phone number not registered and there is another phone number registered which i dont know! The call centre agent not helpful! Giving me different answers which is not helpful! All i ask is why my result still now showing!!	1

20866	Works in theory only IF 1) the whole population has downloaded this app 2) actually has a phone and has it on them when they are out and about, and 3) all users would have to be screened. Unfortunately these criteria severely limit the effectiveness of the app. In terms of the app itself... Doesn't work properly, drains battery quickly and requires GPS usage... Yet another failed government app.	1
20867	After signing-in it does not open. I keep getting a message saying it keeps stopping and asking for app info and sending feedback.	1
20868	Killing my battery in the last 2 days if this keeps up I'll have to uninstall it 3 times yesterday i had to recharge my battery where as it would normally last nearly a full day.	1

20872	This is a great idea to trace out contacts. But it probably work ,when maximum parentage of the population were checked out their RT-PCR and when the greater number ( seems 95%) of the population using an android device. Otherwise it can't helpful.	0

20874	Had a long time to sort out an app and this is what you come up with, Looks good but business I’ve spoken to find the process to create a QR is to hard/complicated for them.\nWhy can’t I add in a location I have visited if the business/organisation does not have the QR code..........

App continued from location selection etc. etc. Finally successful. Thanks to God.	1
20883	The app does not allow me to register and shows error OTP even with all the information entered	1
20884	You have no guarantees using this app and the safeentry system that your data is secure and only used for contact tracing, unlike systems in e.g. the UK. This is normalising government surveillance for the population	1

20941	This app is a scam in terms of contact tracing. It's as good as a phone directory, relying on manual inputs. The Bluetooth functionality is the biggest scam of this app. It claims it records Bluetooth of other devices, but this is a complete lie. If Bluetooth really does work in this app, then why isn't any of my device discoverable even while the app is open? ?? Stop selling lies for publicity.	1

21001	Battery drain quickly.	1
21002	Suggest to improvise the app to boost more related tracing features such as to be able to use it to scan SafeEntry QR code, lock the location then if the subject leaves that location, reminds him to check-out. And, to sound an alert when the subject goes to a location a confirmed case had visited with date and time.	1

21019	Does not detect cases in my barangay/district. I am in a barangay with high covid 19 incidence. For a gov't backed app, you're not doing enough to recruit more users! From 500k last month to just 800k? that's a very thin data set you got there. At least try to actively get more people to sign-up and not just rely on referrals.	1
21020	Not an useful app	1
21021	Latest update needs location services on. Why is that? It did not before. Gov web site says it does not record my location. Location services should not be needed.

21035	1. Integrate with singpass or myInfo to get personal data. \n2. Let app scan for QR code. During scanning also allows Bluetooth to do its work. \n3. Let app detect location or user to select location in advance to prepare for check in, like what Singpass app used to do. \n4. Let user see which location is still checked in so that checking out is easier.	1

21037	Great app, few suggestions. Would like to be able to edit diary, if you accidentally put the wrong date in your can’t change. Also if you could use all QR code’s for businesses using a different type.\n\nMaybe be able to use without internet  could also be a useful feature	0
21038	Wouldn't accept my phone number. Must turn wifi off to accept phone number. Need better instructions to avoid people's confusion	1
21039	App tells me my phone number can\u2019t be recognised, and therefore I can\u2019t get a pin. Very annoying when you want to support an important initiative.	1
21040	Good initiative, but the implementation causes an increase in idle battery drain that is not negligable.	1
21041	Not working in mobile Samsung j1	1
21042	What is happening wirh rhis app?! Why does it log out by itself and gave me headache??!! Lol! Fixed rhis please i cant have back my records... Installed and uninstalled still the result is the same!!	1

21045	Never works properly. For a mandatory app and quick rollout to the entire nation you'd think more time and effort would be put into making sure the app and runs properly on all different platforms. Selfie check-in doesn't work and is almosy always bugged. Submission of the check in rarely goes through, and I have to reset the app several times just for it to work. The assistant is absolutely useless, that is if it worked anyways.	1
21046	Be nice to have a simple way to close the app when you're home.	1

21050	Today morning 09.06.2020 I open the ETHERAZ app and I was notified to update it which I did but it keeps on not responding to my Huawei Y9s. Had to reboot my phone to start afresh but nothing seems to work out so am just stranded I hope you fix the bug	1
21051	It's Very good and It's work well Thanks bahrain	0
21052	I can't use this app because I can't register. I didn't get the OTP even though my phone number is correct	1

21055	Phone constantly out of battery because of this app. Makes overall purpose obsolete	1
21056	It uses the battery so much. Batt gets flat faster	1
21057	This new version keeps auto closing on my Huawei P20 pro phone. The older version will remains open at the background.. But for this version, I very consciously make sure it's open before I took the Train, with my Bluetooth on. When I reach my destination, the app was already shut down in the background. Happen every single time I tried it.	1
21058	Nice	0
21059	Very worst app	1
21060	Good effort, but such bad methods. Keep my bluetooth on till the end of outbreak?! Even if I'm quarantined it won't make sense either. Can you find a better way.	1
21061	Phone number invalid????	1

21081	The Worse APP ever, this app keeps always the Bluetooth on, and drained my battery verry fast, I just install when I have to go out, some times it's showed up a OTP error, but now it says that I had exceeded the the number of activation. Now the app says that I have to call 109, I called and I waited about more than 20 minutes and nobody answered me.	1

21105	Cannot close apps after using. Unfriendly apps. Hated notifications icon alerts when off the Bluetooth.	1
21106	Had this installed since it first released. Uninstalled it once briefly because it started messaging with my Bluetooth devices. Seems this has started happening again so it's gone. Don't think this thing is anywhere near as effective as manual contact tracing, and I doubt it would be much use if I were in a hotspot anyway, because I don't know anyone else who is running this.	1

21119	Useless .just a formality for travelling	1
21120	Good idea, but unfortunately it won't work. Immediately after I install the app and enter it it works fine, but next time I enter the app it keeps throwing me out, so I can't really do anything and if I were to receive a notification I'm not sure if I'll be able to read it. So after trying to download it again and the problems continued, I chose to not keep the app because it's not worth the battery consumption as the app isn't even working.	0

21123	Everything is just fine but I think the NID card number requirement isn't necessary, That requirement make the app complicated	0

21141	Great App	0
21142	Please trace the infected and let me worry about my device security. This app totally violates data privacy policy, as it's grants the government full access to your pictures videos and call logs. I understand GPS permissions for contact tracing COVID-19 potential carriers. But why the app can overcome screen lock? Why do they need to see my storage like appGallery!?	1
21143	App is malfunctioning . Not showing the correct data .	1
21144	Poor performance	1

21174	Best aap for self	0
21175	this is garbage. there is absolutely no reason to use location for what this thing does. bluetooth is an acceptable privacy breach for the cause, but this is beyond anything reasonable. also, if it's as safe as you claim - publish the sources for what you actually deploy, so we can peer review them. just like us, you have nothing to hide. right?	1

21225	This is not a bad review for the sake of it, here are things to change 1. Share this app button, who uses that? Swap it out to either show the places you are checked in, or press it to access the favourites 2. Why do I need to activate the camera for scanning, then be able to press favourites, that should already be in the main menu, thus two \u53cd\u4eba\u7c7bdesign choices make this app more cumbersome to use than what It could have been	1

21245	The App would occasionally cause interference to my car entertainment system when listening to music from my phone via Bluetooth. This would happen when my car is next to another. The problem goes away after the App is uninstalled. Would briefing great if Developer could look into this matter.	1
21246	Not clear if foreigners need to get one but id they do they can't without a Turkish phone number	1
21247	The app demands too much power from the phone. Bluetooth would be ok, but Koronavilkku also demands location on to work.	1

21263	In order to connect to a Bluetooth device all you should need is Bluetooth permission. The fact that some application may use the Bluetooth connection to determine location, should not force the user to give that app even more permissions. Forcing enabling location is wrong.	1

No wonder the spread is getting out of hand, you can't even notify people straight away.	1

21336	Update. Finally able to register the next day. Jan still not happy. . You'd think they would of had the app bug checked by now. Considering the amount of time they have been talking about it. Not happy Jan...! So, I am a Muppet and an inpatient Troll! It now after 6pm and it still won't except my phone number. I have un installed, and re installed.

21345	is screwing up some Bluetooth connections. But that is nothing compared to keeping all of Australia safe. If you don't install this app, get out of Australia ! You will be killing Australians	1
21346	Why the app needs permission to storage? Lot of people concerned about their privacy. If we deny permission to storage. The app doesnt work. People are forced to buy a new phone for this app which doesnt have their private files. As the app made mandatory for all. I request the developers to make an update and drop the permission to the storage please. Also it drains the battery so fast.	1

21353	Every Canadian should download and run this app to help fight the spread of COVID. It will notify you if you have been near someone who has been diagnosed with COVID, assuming they too are using the app. So the more people that use it, the better it will work. Do it to protect yourself and to protect others. \n\nIt is private, safe and secure, and privacy commissioners and independent analysts have provided commentary to that effect.	0

21356	This is not encouraging so the developer of this apps should make it available for iPhone 5 users. Some people may not have the money to buy the latest phone because of this.

21358	While I understand the possible need to scan the QR code the first we are at the location (as opposed to finding it on a list like the Singpass app - Safe Entry), one handy feature that is missing from the Trace Together app that would be good to have is having your favorites show up based on your location rather than showing the full list (reference how Singpass app- Safe Entry handles their favourites)	1

21449	This app was draining my battery and overloading my phones system. My phone also became exceptionally hot, so hot I thought it might possibly catch fire.

21475	A useless application that the Singapore Government trying very hard to enforce the citizens to install if the citizens want country to be in phase 3 mode. Quite likely the application was developed by some highly ranked individually or someone related to one such that the application must not be allowed to have low usage or download rate which would deem the application as a failure and a waste of public funds.	1

What will happen if the app doesn't work on my phone? Do I have to buy a new phone in order to be allowed entry into the country? Can someone please give me some answers. I don't know who to contact about this . Thank you	0

21620	To check if its working just check under your Google (covid-19 notifications) account either threw settings or accounts depending on your phone. The app checks this before saying if its activated that's there's a delay. Multiple devices working for me without problems. Simple app that uses Google api. Would have liked it joined app with covidcare, also swapping between Ireland and NI app, this is not needed as the keys will be shared with other countries as well and you will be notified.	0

21633	The app is good except that is literally killing my battery, forcing me to uninstall it!!	1
21634	Responding to developers response: please tell me the difference in covid between Germany and Czechia please... Can't you make the app more user friendly like it is in Germany? Too difficult? Czechs don't like user friendly apps? Come on! Apparently Czech society does not like UI friendly app, it seems Czechs are different to any other nation, which has UI friendly corona apps, which then get used more often. Perhaps we just have not so intelligent health ministry and their app developers...	1

21665	Not accurate. Someone admitted to hospital near by. And died. But the application says no points of intersection have been found with corona virus patients.	1
21666	Thanks for creating this app, living with someone who is at higher risk if they were infected it gives greater peace of mind now that we are out a bit more during level 2 lockdown. Good to know that if we are exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID we will find out about it much sooner! Would encourage as many people as possible to download and use it so that it reaches its full potential!	0

21669	After recent update the battery drain is terrible. My note 9 does not last 5 hours without needing a charge. Have to keep disabling the app from running. Tried to reinstall same issue reccurs	1
21670	I downloaded the app as soon as we were able to. Last Wednesday I got notified that I had been exposed and to go for testing or self isolate. I was surprised as I have maintained a small bubble. I waited three hours to get tested and when I got into the test centre the notification was gone from my app. It now says that my app has not been exposed. The test centre were considering not testing me. I am very confused on whether I was exposed or not. Whether I need to self isolate or be tested. Now I expect to get another notification as I was three hours with a bunch of people being tested. I called Health Canada and they had no answer. I am considering deleting the app as I am not sure if it is working.	1

21674	When login using NRIC, it indicated only require name and NRIC number. The date of birth and date of issue not required to key in. But if don't key in these 2 information, system refused to let you proceed. Scam app, give incorrect instruction.	1

21678	Great idea in principle but unfortunately of little practical benefit as not every shop or location has a QR code. First time using the app and out of the 5 places I went to yesterday, only one had a QR code. I ended up recording everything in my notepad, but that doesn’t have the advantage of linking in to the contact tracing of the app.\n\nAn easy fix would be to include an ‘add it manually’ option. Search the business or location by address (using address autocomplete that is already active in the app in the personal details section). Include a manual override if the autocomplete doesn’t quite fit. Then a screen to select date and time in time out. It could even be done live with a button to press on entry and exit.\nAlternatively for even easier input, allow location services to locate address, click to confirm, then have the entry and exit buttons to stamp date/time.\n\nAs it stands, it is of very limited use and will only be able to trace a tiny percentage of crowd activity. I buy into the idea and would love to see a more inclusive app... because I want to be contacted if I have been to a place at risk!	1
21679	After installing the TraceTogether app, other devices are pairing to my iPhone without asking for my permission. This is a major security issue.	1
21680	Note 10+ Bluetooth dropouts and Bluetooth performance. Every few minutes a call on headset or music streaming would just cut out, or be completely garbled. Uninstalled so can actually use phone as I need rather than trying to work around performance issues	1
21681	What a positive surprise! Easy to install and understand. Simple and sleek interface. Based on one day usage does not drain the battery. Requires location services (no GPS) to be on so that other devices can be scanned but does NOT use GPS or any other location data. Releasing without English was a mistake and language selection should be available. Other than that this feels like a well done app. Extra points from open source release!	0

21690	I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1,  I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all.  There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number, as well as the \u2018continue\u2019 button the \u2018verily phone number\u2019 text was also showing, however the \u2018continue\u2019 was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately.  As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number.  We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased.  So please install the app and use it.  To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later.  Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths, so please use the app, follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water.     May we all emerge safe and well, however we must all do the right thing.	0
21691	App downloads, starts setup and fails.this is on latest Android 10 phone, news says 700k downloaded.how many uninstalled?	0
21692	Any amazing way to slow the spread of COVID-19. If you download this app, you are saving lives. This app uses bluetooth technology and not location tracking. If you are worried that the government is watching your location then turn off location services in settings for that app.	0

21696	On my Note 10, I don't have any of the problems others mention about bluetooth drop outs to car or Senheisser headphones or Samsung Watch, the only problem I have is the app doesn't start up when I restart the phone, I rarely restart so not a big problem.	1

21699	One of the recent updates lead to a pop-up about an improvement in location services to be shown _every_ time I enable or disable GPS on my phone. This drives me nuts! I had to force stop the application to avoid the pop-ups. I shall wait for an update with fix and if not published promptly - uninstall the application.	1
21700	Good. Except that the Google " Find My Device" does not work to locate an Android phone when CovidSafe app is on. I have tested this and now not wanting to turn CovidSafe app back on because if I lose my phone again, may be unable to find it. Which renders the point of the app ineffective, either way.	0

Any idea if this enhancement is in flight?	1

21709	Very fantastic	0
21710	I think the purpose of this app is great & if a good percentage of the population use it that it would be very effective. Unfortunately it can only be useful if folks are participating. One down side that I have noticed is, as it runs constantly in the background it appears to be very hungry on the battery and therefore my battery life drains a lot faster than expected. At some point I'll have to determine the effectiveness of the app vs device battery life.	0

21721	What's the point!	1
21722	Up to friday everything was fine. Noticed battery draining rapidly and more worrying phone getting hot. Have had to uninstall for now at least.	1
21723	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
21724	When I use the app, my Bluetooth headset experience goes for a toss. However, I hope it is just a temporary sacrifice that we have to make for the greater good.	1

21729	The most useless app ever on android. Sucks battery like crazy. Requires Bluetooth to be constantly switched on. My phone don't revolve around this app. And please stop requesting it to run in the background. The 5 stars rating are probably bots or civil servants forced to give fake reviews.	1
21730	Good and very easy to use	0
21731	This app could save my life. I'm more than happy to let others have a record of having come into contact with me if they become ill with COVID-19. If I get sick then others can be informed if they have been in contact with me. Not being able to tell other people I'm sick won't be on my conscience. This is a lot less data than we surrender to Facebook, Google etc. on a daily basis.	0
21732	A nightmare to install	1
21733	No straightforward possibility to simply link an existing test like in other apps (like the German app), which scan a QR code of the test just made. Generating the code in the app and making sure the testing centre takes it into account is cumbersome, unreliable or with some testing centres (e.g. Ecolog testing centre at Brussels Airport) plainly impossible!	1

It would be useful if the technical support is available and also if these technical hick-ups are resolved to enhance functionality.	1
21813	Would love to use the app but the Ts&Cs are riddled with errors (even after the most recent update), undefined terms and - buried near the end - a reference to how the developers might "remotely access your device (s)" through undisclosed means. Proof-reading the Ts&Cs is the easiest QA of all, so this doesn't bode well for the actual code; all enough for me to give it a miss for now and promptly uninstall.	0

Extremely high Gulf of evaluation & gulf of execution. All in All, extremely disgusted with this app. Using this is like being force fed combat rations. Sure it helps keep you alive; but it's disgusting and at that point in time you'd wish you weren't alive instead.	1
21833	force close	1
21834	Useless app i would give a 0 start for this app i was tested positive 6 months back i am negative for past 5 months i have taken multiple results all are negative but still this app shows positive	1
21835	Easy to install. Simply explains the data sharing and storage.	0
21836	Save the world!	0
21837	Great	0
21838	Worst app	1
21839	Basically drops my car bluetooth every few minutes. It reconnects after few seconds. Very annoying.	1
21840	Good one..! But need more update and fix.	0
21841	Good thank you	0
21842	Its a nice app but one problem in this app now that the map only show qurantine locations.The map not show carona patiebts now please fix this problem	1
21843	Ito good	0
21844	...not very clear how it\u2019s actually implemented. The notification sent every morning implies you need the app open on your screen to be effective. Why not take a little extra time to develop something that works in the background? Sure, millions might download, but if it\u2019s a requirement to keep it open and few do, it\u2019s not gonna help much.  Also, the daily notification is annoying. When I turned notifications off, the app implied it would no longer work without it. Want to help, but do I really need a notification every morning to do so?  Minus one star for each of the above, but 3 stars for: a simple on boarding process; a clean design; and for getting it out quickly. Hoping it still works in the background!	1
21845	Let's help Singapore altogether! I need to feedback the app always die at the moment when I am out packing, lol, can you guys do something about it. Defeats the purpose if it crashes when that's the time the app should work!	0
21846	Battery consuming, ask to turn on Bluetooth for 24/7 , what's a wasting of battery.	1
21847	Over All good app. Updates are informative & multiple options. All updates are according to Govt of Pakistan's official COVID-19 status. On technical basis this app consumes/drains more device resources & memory, which is very strange thing to notice. Perhaps devs solve this issue in time.	0
21848	Worst app	1
21849	Ok	1
21850	Crashes as soon as it opens	1
21851	Drains the battery really quickly.	1
21852	By far the easiest and most secure app! Keep, keeping us safe Canada!	0
21853	It won't even let me complete the first step to verify my number, please fix this I'm planning on travelling to turkey and i need the hes code	1

21855	They deleted my review once and i am writing it second time This app is just another jumla by our respected and illiterate PM and does as my functions as our current FM. I had few positive cases around my home one of them just 50 m away but it says i am safe.	1

21878	I'll suggest the government open up all the electricity power points in public places like bus stop, interchanges, mrt, malls, hdb, everywhere so that we can recharge our phone whenever needed. This app is draining off our phone battery. Seriously, COVID-19 is not a very threatening virus. Media has over played this. Outside SG, everywhere doctors are already coming out to say the virus mortality rate is less than 1%. In SG, out of 58,046 cases only 28 died from it. That's 0.048%! V low!!!	1
21879	Good	0
21880	I need to uninstall and reinstall the app every time I activate it to make it work. This is rather frustrating and time-consuming, and defeats the purpose of being able to open the app and have it running at a moment's notice when you're near other people.	1
21881	After I did the update ehtiraz is not responding at all now ... how come you do a soft ware with a such kind of errors This soft ware is managing our movement in the country .... how come this issue is occurred ... and how can we manage our movement if no one will allow us to enter their places only if ehtiraz is valid Thx	1
21882	Have an OPPO phone and tired of "correcting" battery optimisation. Will likely delete it if is not remedied.	1
21883	I thought this app would use a lot of battery due to Bluetooth, but it uses only 1% per hour, which is very reasonable. I also was concerned that the app would track my location, but it works on Android even with location settings turned off, which is my default (I never have location on). For the very minimal amount of data it collects, I am more than happy having this app on my phone and running constantly. Will make contact tracing significantly expedited and accurate. A lifesaver of an app.	1
21884	Seems like I can register only using an Indian number, then what am I supposed to do if I have only a foreign number? It is stupid.	1
21885	After last update the app is constantly asking if I turned off my Bluetooth!! I never do! Also, because I have Apple Watch and I need Bluetooth always on... please fix!	1
21886	Great idea.	0

21894	App is fine. Remember to leave the first \u20180\u2019 off your mobile phone number otherwise it will not work! Should have a note explaining that on the phone number screen	0

21900	Since three day app not working, every time I receive this massage(\u062a\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0646\u0627 has stopped)	1
21901	I tried 4 times to register. Each time the facial recognition did not work. It's too difficult. Wasted my time.	1
21902	I downloaded the app but when I am trying to login and it asks for OTP I never recieve the OTP !! Because of which I am not able to use this app and when I enter my mobile no. again it says error,how am I supposed to use this app when I am not able to login??!!	1
21903	It works only with a Turkish phone number. Also, can't change language to Turkish.	1
21904	It worked for a few days but then stopped working. The app say it is working fine but when I am going out the counter stays at 0. My fried who is with me sees on the app that she came in close to proximity to 10 pax.	1
21905	Superb app Very knowledgeable	0
21906	Good	0
21907	Application is great excellent idea but Battery goes down very fast my full charged phone lasts couple of hours ! Why would you want access to my private information!! My storage which include my private family pic and otheres ! No privacy by using this app while iphone holders have no issues with this !	1
21908	The app is consuming all the battery life. Fix the issue cause I'm going to Uninstall the app	1

21916	I have this question mark for couple of days.. I already did uninstalled installed several times... I even followed one steps clearing the cache and more but it's still the same.. I am just so sad about this I couldn't go to the supermarkets and even money exchange wouldn't allowed me to go inside	1
21917	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
21918	Good to know that Philippines is embracing modernization thru the filipino-made app, Staysafe.ph that we should be truly proud of. It aids to the government's need of contact tracing, citizen's health condition reporting and social distancing in the midst of COVID 19 outbreak.	0
21919	Screws up other blue tooth apps	1

21921	Ur App SUCKS	1
21922	Phone number required. What is the point of a pseudonym if the account must have a mobile phone number associated, which by law must have positive ID associated? Seriously I was finally ready to take a risk and then I saw that BS. Is it any wonder adoption rates are low? Contact people through the APP morons	1
21923	After many months simply crashing when I try to activate it, now the app displays an error message instead: cannot provide crypto id, no ephemeral bluetooth identifier found. That's progress, I hope it'll actually work someday.	1
21924	Mandatory download. Its okay so far, i notice a lot more battery draines because of the constant bluetooth ON.	1

21931	Generally works just fine. Would like it if the notification saying its working wasn't there constantly. Also cant seem to get my phone to stay connected to my smart watch woth this app pinging the bluetooth all the time. Should be a simple fix for devs.	0

21940	Such a pathetic app!!!\nNo information on proximity with contagious person. It gives you only stats. Such a waste of time and money (I suppose). The Council of Ministers should be more careful before relying on such misleading apps. Unless the main purpose is to collect personal data, is it so???!!!	1

21946	Had this app for about a week.. Phone got almost red hot few days ago, battery died in 30 min after full charge...yesterday morning heard on a radio that this app does that...wiped phone after...now my battery charges only up to 68% . App destroyed my battery.	1

21953	It looks like from the 8th of August people are reporting phones overheating and batteries draining. This is happening to everyone in my household and the covid application is causing the problem. This is extremely serious because people will just uninstall the app if it's killing their batteries. Developers please take note and fix this urgently.	1

21978	This App could have been so much better if it hadn't been rushed. I have an Oppo phone and the App caused a lot of problems with it, had to uninstall. Not recommended people !!!	1
21979	Worst app	1
21980	I have registered in the app with correct information. But neither login nor forget password steps working. It shows "Please make sure that the information is correct". And there is no live support No chat how we resolved it, where we have to report bugs.	1

22031	I'm sure it performs an important function, but it burns thru mobile phone battery at prob 30-40% higher rate that when the app is absent.	1
22032	This latest iteration tells you how many people you have been in contact with. I tested it. Yesterday during my exercise the number of contacts increased by 14. I had walked continuous for 45 minutes, did not need to stop to cross road. I walk behind one person, until I was able to overtake. I did pass several people sitting at bus stops. We were told that contacts would be recorded based on within 2 metres for 1 minute. From my test, it would appear the time element is not working.	1
22033	The App not working with my android phone. \ud83d\ude13	1
22034	Installed from early on. Haven't seen any alerts on cases nearby. Why does this app need Bluetooth to be on at all times? Bluetooth uses up more battery life. And notifications are not able to be cleared. Poorly designed app. India has some of the best programmers and yet govt apps and websites are so poorly designed.	1

22044	Battery drain is crazy. The new update needs to be rectified or you'll see bulk disengagement with the app. Half a day and it's used 12.6% of my battery. If it wasn't 4500 mAh I'd be stuffed.	1
22045	Turns itself off after one minute	1
22046	I have used the NHS app to order repeat prescriptions on numerous occasions with no problems, it is much easier than trying to ring the surgery, also i had a small problem which would have entailed going to see a gp, but i used the app , was contacted by a doctor, and after sending her a photo via email the relevant cream was ordered and the problem was resolved, brilliant service	0

22060	It drains my battery like nothing else. It is great to be covid safe but if my phone dies at 2pm it doesn't help anymore. In average it takes about 20-25% of my battery which is unbearable.	1

22064	App drains battery too quickly (59% to 53% in 15min of idle) and keeps phone warm when idle on a tabletop. I don't mind helping the government, but not at the expense of my phone's longevity... EDIT: Developer has replied that drain is marginally greater on phones with Bluetooth enabled. But in the first place, your phone's Bluetooth should not be turned on all the time if you you want to save battery!	1

22082	While out and about on a full working day, with numerous SafeEntry check-ins and check-outs, the app reported ZERO (0) Bluetooth exchanges, even though there were many encounters with others. Surely, it is improbable that all these people are not using TraceTogether. During the day, I had my phone paired via Bluetooth to my smart watch. If I can't use TraceTogether with other Bluetooth devices, then it is not totally unacceptable.	1

22095	Do we need to keep our wifi on 24 x 7 during self isolation or is there a particular time till which the wifi should be kept on. Kindly respond	1
22096	It should use the Apple/Google Exposure Notification framework. Otherwise, this is ineffective.	1
22097	Lately keep crashing on opening the app or blank white screen after check in from app (check in from quick shortcut don't have this issue)	1
22098	Battery life really under pressure in last few days. Also issue fast charging the phone - not sure if that is connected to this app but both happened almost together.	1
22099	I dont have a nric number none of the options are relivent to united kingdom are people who don't own a passport the app was blue since it turned red I can no longer get on it and had to uninstall the app as I don't have nric as I don't have any photo I'd of any sort so this app is a compleat waste of time for me living in North West	1
22100	1.No one answer more than 31 minutes . 2.exceed number of activation call 109 am surely only one time tried. 3.20qrs I have been spend waiting to answer for call 109 no one pick the call . So useless for that am planing to go back	1
22101	Such a useless application.	1
22102	I don't have any experience yet. But 5 stars for the great app. The app lets users to use one mobile numbers on multiple devices that I had come across on the 26 of April. I don't know it still allows multiple users for a same number.	0

22129	This app has just been updated about 2 minutes ago. Now another feature has just been added- a history containing the number of bluetooth exchanges made each day. I have no idea of why this feature is added but I think it is added to inform users of the number of bluetooth exchanges made each day so that the users will exercise caution in wherever they are and whatever they do.	0

22143	I have iPhone XR & have been using this app since the day Quebec officially asked everyone to use it. So far no complaints but the latest app update is drowning the battery life like crazy. The app used 20% battery life in 6 hrs. I uninstalled it to verify that it’s this app & guess what I was right. Developers please fix this if you want people to use it. Thanks	1
22144	I tried to log in but Didn't get OTP. Useless wasting time only.	1

22147	Why can't make the profile, i mean NRIC work permit i submitted my FIN number then it will be show invalid..... Any idea please!!!	1
22148	The only reason to install the app is to be notified about the infection around. If the app does not send the push notifications, but you have to enter it to check that, it makes this app completely useless!	1
22149	Helping	0
22150	Awesome! Suggest to be able to install to smart watch OR release a smart powered device where this tracker is installed and kept on tracking, and linked to the phone, so it will free user to continue using their phones while the device is tracking.

Will use IC for entry tracker for some placed that insist of using Tracetogether apps.	1

22158	Make masks mandatory and treat hairdressers and barbers the same as pubs. It's being flouted all over the country. 4 months of a lock down for nothing because of these idiots.	0
22159	Great idea but I'm really unsure of its effectiveness. Its usefulness depends entirely on people who have tested positive and who have downloaded the app and who have registered themselves as positive and who also go around the city and who have their Bluetooth and location on all the time and you as the user always having battery drain nng location and Bluetooth on... So the % of times all of those factors coincide make it unlikely to provide much actual use unless enough people use it properl.	1
22160	Good software	0

22167	I downloaded this app successfully in the starting ,then all of sudden it was blank page ,so I reinstalled it and it worked for a 2-3weeks and then yesterday again while going for a walk , it was only showing a question mark ,I tried to reinstall it 3 times but no success.I would like the govt. to look into this matter and find a solution .	1
22168	While the purpose of this app is great it sucks the life out of my battery. I have an up to date phone and have nothing else running in the background like this app. I think I'll stick to what I've been doing.	1
22169	Useless	1
22170	It does the job. I'd like a notification reminder. Most times I don't check in cause I went to bed just past midnight. If it were the kind of notif where you can also just press "no symptoms" from the notification itself that'd be very convenient and easy to use. Imo, don't force a notification on people - let them opt in.	1

After installing this trace together app my battery won’t charge more than 80% due to high temperature. \n\nAfter I deleted the app everything goes back to normal. \n\nHow are we going to support government roll out measure when your apps is giving problem.	1
22203	Today you kept us safe,  You took action, You showed you cared. You installed the COVIDSafe app. Today you kept us safe, You helped people get back to work.

22220	TOTALLY USELESS if you have a non-Turkish phone number. Since early June, everyone must have an HES code to travel within Turkey, but if you are foreigner you can't get it through this app unless you buy a local number. How are you going to do that if you are buying your ticket when you're out of Turkey, no idea. The only remaining option is to send an sms with your passport info to a short number, but depending on your current country it will be redirected somewhere else, so again no luck.	1

22234	A well designed app with privacy and user experience at heart. Uses the Apple contract tracing API. No GPS permissions are asked for. I don’t understand how people can install Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps etc etc (all track your location) and not want to install the one app that could save you, you friends and family from disease. Let’s all download this app and help rebuild our community’s and our country!\nThis app does not work on older unsupported versions of iOS because it has user privacy baked into the operating system. The alternative for unsupported iOS versions is location tracking, server stored data and poor battery usage, which no one wants!	0

22251	Ok	0
22252	I understand the importance of the app and am comfortable with the privacy precautions even though I would agree there are definitely concerns about data collection. For the moment though I think it\u2019s an important public health and safety tool in the current situation.   When I downloaded it I assumed it would have an option to run in the background if allowed so I didn\u2019t have to have it open all the time. This doesn\u2019t seem to be the case but I don\u2019t mind that too much, I just have to keep remembering to open it again.   However, the main issue is that every time I open it or even if it\u2019s been open for a while it seems to go inactive and makes me sign up and reactivate again which is very impractical and inefficient. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Otherwise it seems to work fine.	0

22267	Unsure of value of app until it's required but it's seriously detrimental to Bluetooth connectivity. Can't steadily stream music to my headphones etc, Can't connect my fitbit for exercise, Can't hotspot internet for my tablet. Poor effort really, if it was any other app, no one in their right mind would allow such a detrimental impact to the standard running of their phone.	1
22268	Over the last few days the app is causing a massive drain on the battery needs to be addressed. Very slow to update the statistics shouldn't be that hard. Oh wait it's the HSE	1

Call center agents are clueless and even on choosing English as an option I'm diverted to Arabic speaking agents. Hope the developers can take this review seriously for an app as critical to the nation's well being.	1
