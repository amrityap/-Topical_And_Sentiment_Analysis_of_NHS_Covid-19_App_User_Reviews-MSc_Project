16	I tested on 30.4.2020, result showing not tested, when i called customer care, they told it will only show results of drive through test.	1
17	No problems with the app as far as I am concerned. Better to be safe than sorry.	0
18	Great app! But I hope you can improve the scanning results and also the summary/timeline details shows zero cases. I hope data that's supposed to be listed there come up immediately when we open the app. Nothing appears up until now and it affects the credebility of this app.	0
19	Good	0
20	One the the worst app I have ever seen.	1
21	Radius alert is extremely not worth, my dad has been declared as covid-19 patient but they are showing my homes location as safe zone!! Extremely dissatisfied!	1

23	Excellent service	0
24	Latest update messed up battery consumption of the app. Consistently being the top battery consumption app by a huge margin over other apps(even games) on my phone.	1
25	Worst app. No authenticity	1
26	Very good idea and implementation	0
27	Aside from the battery drain bump due to Google messing up the play services component, seems to be relative straight forward to use. Would be nice if the national picture and overall number stats provided last 7 day and 14 day versions as the total numbers aren't particularly useful at this stage. Maybe even provide per 100k numbers?	1
28	Poor	1
29	Very Good	0
30	Longest app to download and install, and I download a lot. No problems, download site must have been in high demand. Setup was easy, lots of opt in/out choices. No brainer use of a gadget we all carry with us. Be nice to have an option to check nearby coarse region that recently (14 days) triggered cases are located, maybe on an update.	0
31	Decent	0

33	Reduced battery life for my phone, interrupts music playing from Bluetooth earpiece while this app is running. Have to pause it for music to play continously.	1
34	I not received OTP number	1
35	Best App to contain COVID19	0
36	It's a great idea, and I have used it since release. I just realised though that I have lately started to forget to checking. Perhaps there should be a push notification to prompt users to check in?	0
37	Update is clunky	1
38	Battery consumption has gone through the roof.. whats the use of the app if my phone runs out of battery...	1
39	Says my mobile number is invalid. Not very well designed or tested. What's the point of asking people to join if you can't use it.	1
40	No problem at all with this app, I can see that many people still complaining about some crashes/bugs... But I think many people still not have understood that the Bluetooth must be turn on all the time or else the app will stop working, also if people had the previous version they should uninstall it and then install the new one, I did simply the update first but the app was not able to work properly, that's why I uninstalled it and reinstall it and Voilà it was working	0
41	Nice post Thanks	0
42	All fields entered. But still can't proceed. Keep prompting cHeck field In red. But there is nothing wrong and yet I still unable to update	1
43	Good app and it protects your data. Everyone in Australia should be using this for contact tracing.	0
44	This thing drains my battery. I used to only charge every second day, now I have to charge daily, sometimes twice a day. And this is on a Samsung S20, so not an old phone at all	1
45	Stop using this app to protect your personal information from getting into wrong hands. There's no legal binding that forces users to install this App. Furthermore, for pacemaker patients in particular having multiple bluetooth devices in close proximity is a health risk.	1
46	Bad update then black listed my number for trying to activate while they had the bug active really bad design negate the actual function	1
47	Once you registered in absher you cannot registered in Tawakkalna.. Sad that this is the only one that i can access my permit...	1

57	Easy to install, works good on my iPhone 10. Everyone should have this app. Haven’t seen any battery change. Please be responsible and download this app.	0
58	Disappointing app, i email month ago regarding the bluetooth issue in which is interfering with my bluetooth device which is still going on till date and there no reply at all. Should have ensure all is working before releasing.	1

70	Doesn't get past the registration screen Downloads and installs fine but when I open it it just Freezes after the name, age and postcode screen - Continue button is never highlighted.	1
71	Worst Experience After Downloaded	1
72	good appe	0
73	I can't get past the first screen. There is a button that says 'I want to help' but no other options. I'm trying to find a skip option, but there is nothing. I'm not doing this because I 'want to'.	1
74	Great idea but eats up my phone's battery like no tomorrow, which considering its point is to somewhat monitor someone's surroundings, it's a pretty big deal if it eats up your battery life as a dead phone won't keep anyone safe.	0
75	I want to set up a barcode for both of my children and found that it seemed to be impossible to do it in the app. It only allows one profile per phone	1
76	Waste of batteries. Dont like this at all. Qr code scan already bad enough at most area. Now this. Might as well dont go work.stay at home till all over. I not support anything like this at all.	1
77	Insanse gift from. Totally a useless thing	1
78	Nice	0
79	This app will not work when not run by a government that cannot run a country.	1
80	I like the app and what it's intended for and have used it diligently since installing it. On 8th Aug both my phone and my wifes phone started getting getting hot, losing battery life faster. It's like something got dialled up in the app. I reluctantly disabled it for that reason.	1
81	Keep saying unavailable to log in.	1
82	I love Ehteraz	0
83	Why does the app need to access my camera, files etc? Isn't location and Bluetooth good enough? Seems like you not only want to track our movements but also want to know everything about us. It's an intrusion into our privacy. Whatever spin you are telling us, we just don't buy it. Data security? Well you don't exactly have a good track record on that. Before the election, you said it wasn't mandatory but now that the election is over, you say its mandatory. And you still expect us to believe u	1
84	It is so poor condition app it doesn't work properly .useless I hate this app.actually my relatives are attacking by virus it Did not give any alarm...	1
85	Easy to sign up. Feeling the aussie spirit doing our bit to help keep info flowing to help assist stopping the spread. Everyone worrying about privacy, I think our everyday lives on smartphones has already shown our priorities with this issue. Well done.	0

91	The proceed button for the ID is not working So it is very disappointing. I also went to the website but it was not helpful. I am using student pass. Please help	1
92	My husband tested positive, it took 3 days to inform me and it still hasn't informed my son. Thankfully we knew but if it had been a stranger on a bus we would unknowingly be spreading covid all over the place. Not fit for purpose	1
93	Easy to install and it has been running for the whole day without any issues on my Android phone.	0
94	Good	0
95	Is your application secretly listening to our conversation? Why is there a weird notification from google stored in a secure folder when I installed this application? I tested when I uninstall this application it won't appear but once installed, the icon appear, and if I click on it, it will disappear	1

116	I don't understand the use of it	1
117	I cannot open the app. Multiple times I uninstalled then install again the app but same thing happens. It keeps crashing.	1
118	Worst app ever i have been downloaded ??	1
119	It's a good app. But this is my second time reinstalling it. And the reason why I uninstalled the first time was because of its battery consumption. My phone went from 100 to 10% within 4 hrs.. Is there anyway that the app can be more energy efficient? By the way, I'm using an old phone. Samsung S9. Imagine people using the older phone. Their phone will be drained even faster. I strongly believe this is one of the main reasons why the take-up rate by public is so low.	1
120	Whoever made this app has no common sense whatsoever. Firstly, as a national serviceman I do not have my NRIC and thus no way to see what my NRIC date of issue is. I had to go beg an incompetent S1 branch for it. Secondly, it takes such a long time to open the app. Huge inconvenience to users. Thirdly, the above mentioned points only apply if one is even able to set up the app(watching grass grow is faster and frankly less infuriating). Thanks for nothing.	1
121	Not workibg	1
122	Crash........ Useless	1
123	Excellent	0
124	Very good application	0
125	Pointless as it only works if I have GPS on all day which flattens the battery. So I've had it installed for months, but hardly ever works as I disable GPS most of the time. Wouldn't it be better to still capture near Bluetooth device details regardless of location by GPS?	1
126	So poor. Customer service not even speak English and couldn't resolve my issues which is related to ALHOSN UAE application.	1
127	Seems fine.	0
128	I downloaded the app and registered successfully with my emirates ID and mobile number. When I want to check my test result. It didn't show, It said My mobile number is wrong and need to log out. I had only one mobile number, and the mobile number that they show on the app is not mine. How is this possible?	1
129	Terms and conditions and privacy link got 502...	1
130	where feeling safe..	0
131	Download app could not get past registration as it did not recognise my mobile number. Kept saying invalid mobile number.	1
132	After a few updates it finally became the app that just runs in the background without impacting other apps, Bluetooth, etc. Its just there in the background and i don't even remember i have it installed	1
133	Works. One suggestion the picture in the App shows people not being at safe distance and not wearing mask. Feels a bit out of place for this App's intend.	0
134	Its GREAT! It makes me feel proud seeing Philippine advances its technology to the next level. As an IT person, I personally like the idea of putting such effort to resolve this pandemic global issue. For me, It somehow gives relief and confidence to people that are being scared or paranoid in their daily trips for it provides contact tracing capability. Although it might sacrifice a bit your mobile's battery, at least you are aware of your circle. KUDOS to Philippine Government & Developers	0

139	The app is simple, doesn’t get in my way, shows useful information about how to use it and importantly, doesn’t show any noticeable difference to battery usage.\n\nFor all those writing on Facebook, Twitter, etc about privacy concerns, you have much better privacy with this app than the social media platforms you’re writing your concerns on. Plus you have the ability to help limit the spread of COVID-19.	0
140	Very delay in getting result After all it works fine	1
141	What's problem my tawakkalana not work	1
142	Great app, thanks KSA	0
143	I like losing 50% of my battery cos of bluetooth , ngl its pretty epik.	1
144	It needs to run in the background with Bluetooth always turned on leading to high battery usage. For someone who doesn't have a charger or power bank handy, this is very inconvenient. In its current state, the app shouldn't be made the only app for scanning SafeEntry QR codes.	1
145	Hi im unable to download past 63% this version. Uninstalled older version because sgworkpass shows i do not have app.	1
146	This app is showing the device is rooted and not getting open how can I solve this problem	1

148	It downloaded perfectly and I was able to register. Remember to perhaps not include the first zero in your mobile number when you register. If you tried earlier today, it may not have worked as they did say from 6pm.	0
149	I have not been able to finish setting up (entering personal data etc) after updating the app recently and even after uninstalling and reinstalling it (can't even get OTP). It says there's network issue.	1
150	poor app	1
151	It's a good app. But what's the guarantee that people always carry their phone around? Ineffective till the entire population has this app installed, including migrant workers. People who are commenting that there's no affect on battery life, please observe carefully.	0

162	Would be irresponsible to not have this app. It will help Australia prevent large outbreaks and allow us to live more normally. The reviews about Bluetooth dropping out seem to not be generally true. I use Airpods via Bluetooth with my Samsung S8 and it all works fine.	1
163	Great app but I had to uninstall it because it was draining my battery and my phone is overwheating. Will reinstall once this bug is fixed. Using a galaxy S9	1
164	My device is not rooted but it shows that it is. Please recognize the OnePlus 6 and the others as one of the normal users to your app.	1

197	Few months ago I once tried it for a week or two i.e. on a 2019 Samsung Galaxy phone with huge mAh Battery, I got the impression it worked THOUGH not properly Tested. Recently Got rid of phone due to GPS and BT issues. Was NOW thinking of re-installing it on a 3yo XIAOMI Phone. GLAD I stopped to read Reviews. AMAZED that DEV has NO INTEREST in FEEDBACKS nor giving solutions. That to me equates to NOT caring if App works OR gas given up on it....you be the judge. My mind is NOW 100% made up \ud83d\udd1a	1

I have deleted and reinstall , I clear the phone cache too. But still fail. I'm using android phone. Can anyone help me? I have repeat same sequence. Uninstall and reinstall again today.

246	My phone kept overheating and draining the battery this has stopped since deleting this	1
247	Good idea, good app. There seems to be some confusion as to what this app does or what it is for. If you leave your Bluetooth on, the app keeps an eye out for other phones whose owners are known to have tested positive. It will then alert you (it will not tell you who they are) so that you can immediately isolate while you wait to see if you develop symptoms or get tested, thereby avoiding passing it on without knowing it. The more people have the app, the better it works.	1
248	Not able to register, for some reason it's just staying still!!!!	1
249	Useless and utter nonsense	1
250	Ok so it says my mobile is not a valid number... Come on you need to do better than this	1

258	I been having same bluetooth earphone lagging and disconnecting issue since i installed this app. Similar issues with other reviews shared by multiple users. Pls look into this issue, as it's not a one off incident.	1
259	It does not tell you if you're nearby people with symptoms so that's false advertisement for starts, second of all, nobody wants to waste their battery with bluetooth on 24/7. This app is just so pointless and does literally nothing	1

292	Worst app. No update or notification for recent contacts. It just show high risk of infection all the time when u feed some symptoms nothing else. I don't understand why the hell government developed it.. when it was of no use for public. It just shows stats of covid.. which anyone can check on google or websites.	1

305	What a dumb app? After updating not woking. Ask for restart always. As a mandatory app this must not like this. Please fix.	1
306	There is no interaction with the app on how it works and why the GPS signal is needed (drains more battery). But you only need to install a GPS emulator app to report a fake location if privacy is your concern.	1

315	The app is fine but what I dont understand is why do you need storge and phone call access and keep the bluetooth on? GPS tracking should suffice to know where the person has been, having gps turned on all the time drains the battery and having bluetooth on as well drains the battery even more	1
316	So i can't see if anyone in nearby is infected by corona. Whats the point of this app?And in what basis this app is saying i haven’t been in contact with any covid 19 patient?	1

326	Mobile phone is overheating lately due to this app. I have deleted a significant number of other apps or stopped them. This is the only app which I haven't touched and it is making my mobile phone overheat While I do love the concept of this app. I am nervous of how hot my mobile gets especially when a warning of plug out due to excessive heat I had warnings of CPU being overloaded and each time this app was highlighted to me. I want to use this but cannot. Can these issues be fixed?	1

341	Bug identified! This interferes with mobile hotspot and repeatedly causes dropping of signal. Have to turn bluetooth off and therefore disable covid safe to be able to use mobile hotspot function which is how I access internet. Not too bad as I mostly tether at home, but it then relies on me remembering to reenable the app and bluetooth before I go out. May get better usage if that bug is addressed. Hope this helps and thank you to the teams behind this in efforts to keep us all safe!	1

351	No phone or battery issues on my samsung a5. Would like to see time shortened from 15 minutes to 1 or 2 minutes and warn me when I'm close to someone would be much better so I can move away. Otherwise it's fine. Can't see the point of having it if it waits 15 minutes to say I've been close to someone that's not good.	1
352	It is a flawed app... It gives silent reminders and always we have "check in" which is not ideal for everyone... What if someone misses a check in when he's in a bathroom? It's THAT annoying... Rest all it's an OK app for residents..	1
353	App requires my Bluetooth to be visible and in pairing mode 24/7. Constant notifications asking for pairing requests. Not to mention it hogs the Bluetooth so none of my connected devices work correctly. No notifications on my Fitbit and continual interference with the audio stream to my headphones while app was installed. Uninstalling the app fixed all of my issues - weird, huh?	1
354	this app for awareness and make us safe from other who nearly infected by covid 19, for this it's need access our always on location and Bluetooth, but why this app need to access(permission) our gallery , photo, and call log, Please lets us know, then I can give 5 star \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f rating as well as we can use this app without fear	0

369	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

373	The app is extremely laggy and expensive in terms of power. It also isn't worth the cost of my blue tooth on the whole time. In addition, I do not want to give my consent to share my private information with the government, and so it doesn't allow me to use it.	1
374	I am very concern about hp battery issue. My hp battery really consume a lot due to bluetooth need to on 24/7. One more thing is privacy, strangers can also send unidentified files. Is there no other alternative way to use this apps? Hope developer can improve on these matters.	1
375	Was okay the first few weeks, after one of the updates it just messes with my Bluetooth, turning it on and off after redownloading it again. Battery consumption was increased too	1
376	Reinstalled the app. Now it doesnt crash anynore. Thanks.	0
377	Pathetic. Cannot accept phone number !!! Somebody ought to be sacked. Please do so.	1
378	Worked fine until this weekend. Suddenly started draining my phone battery. Normally my battery lasts 2 days. It now lasts barely 6 hours. Phone is becoming super hot too. Trouble shooted this by turning on developer options on phone. Wiped cache and also wiped cache on Google play store. Uninstalled and reinstalled apps that were recently updated. Discovered this app is to blame. Once uninstalled phone returned to normal operation and battery life. A fix is urgently needed	1

387	For those complaining about Bluetooth requirements it is a fundamental requirement for how these apps work. In order to detect if you have been within 2 metres of another app user for 15 minutes it needs to use Bluetooth. It is all done in a very privacy friendly way. Look up the details on how it works if you are concerned.	0

392	This is very worst application since I have been using from starting date that time it was going good but suddenly questions mark came and when I uninstall and then reinstall still it's shows questions mark.........you guys should work hard on it .	1

402	After having this app in Vancouver for over a month. It still says ‘no reporting in your area. \n\nCompletely disappointed that this app is dead on BC. One would think this limitation would be resolved. If you can’t report what good is the app?\n\nThanks Canada for leaving BC with ‘nothing’.	1
403	Can't even proceed to update my app even after input all personal informations required and it didn't even prompt what went wrong.	1

413	Extremely bad application. Always not working at all. Why do you keep it in the playstore?!	1
414	Requires location service to be "on" to detect devices near you.. well I'm not going to use the app then. Make it useful with the location setting "off" and I will start to use it. I might not be sharing my location but I do not accept that it needs location access when it is not necessary. Bluetooth works just fine with location service off. I don't care that smittestop doesn't track my movements, but it enforces everyone to turn on location giving Google and other apps access to my location.	1
415	Worst app ever, battery drain and constantly on. Should only turn on when you choose. Has constant alert when blue tooth is turned off. Needs to be more user friendly	1
416	The latest version is definitely improved and more intuitive to use, but I feel there's something wrong with Android version installed in Huawei (Nova3i) Mobile. I see very less count of interactions or sometimes even 0 whereas it shows a drastic difference with my spouse's Mobile which is Samsung S10. Kindly verify this case with your testing devices. Thanks.	1

There should be better filtering else this is just providing useless data and causing inconvenience if one of these hundreds of supposed "close contacts" happen to fall sick!	1
441	After installation, I could not play video/youtube. After uninstalling, video/youtube get back to normal. Please help to resolve the bug. I am using Note 9	1
442	I HAVE DONE A COVID TEST 4 DAYS BACK AND THE APP SAYS (NOT TESTED). PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ERROR	1
443	So I have just found out the mobile number I have been using for ages is invalid. So much for using the app.	1
444	Good	0
445	Can’t even sign in. Tells you to enter the code sent to an email, when you come back to the app after checking email, the keyboard disappears! Can’t go forward or back. When trying again, says email is already used even though the registration wasn’t completed! Who developed this??	1
446	Works as expected, but a big battery drain.	1
447	Drains to much battery with Bluetooth on all the time. In spite my data privacy concerns, I think it is a good move to improve contact tracing but the app could provide a list of the places, with date and time, where I checked in for my own control. It is already collecting my info so why not allow me to access it?	1
448	I cant set up my profile ? I entered in my student pass number and everything correctly but it keeps saying temporary unavailable and its been like this for some time already ??	1
449	Consume too much baterrei, registration is too complicated, can not stop while at home, the safe entry qr code is much more simpler.	1
450	I using Samsung Note3. This App after updated can't load already. Tried uninstall & install again. The App show : "Your device isn't compatible with this version." People said : is good chance to change the phone. So I buy another phone just for download this App. Cheers. I feedback just to let people know this App can't download or can't loading just because of your phone is too old. But some people said because their is Huawei brands so can not use Google / Appstore. I don't know.. Maybe..	1

467	After calling 109, you don't solve the issue but taking details and inform someone from technical team will call within 24 to 48 hours surely. I prefer if you can reset the app on the spot ones you get down the caller details. Am already stuck inhouse more than 48 hours, I don't have enough food then I have to wait for more than 24hrs and am not sure if the issue will be solved. Am still waiting.	1
468	This new version keeps auto closing on my Huawei P20 pro phone. The older version will remains open at the background.. But for this version, I very consciously make sure it's open before I took the Train, with my Bluetooth on. When I reach my destination, the app was already shut down in the background. Happen every single time I tried it.	1

486	Take forever to verify. uninstalled then	1
487	Unable to Register, keeps telling me my mobile phone number is invalid	1
488	Apart from occasional bugs (cannot check out) I hope they will improve on the followings from user experience:\n\n1) the home screen takes up half of the screen space and won’t scroll away. It also doesn’t offer any useful info apart from showing an image of three persons with active mobile phones. \n\n2) home screen should display a list of all checked-in places, instead of showing just the latest one. This allows users to see at once where have they not checked out yet instead of having to check out one by one.  We really have no time for this especially when our hands are occupied with heavy groceries.	1

505	Good app to start with!\n\nHowever, suggest to use GPS from the service provider, instead of opening the app and running it in the background — May want to refer to Pokémon go (adventure tracing) where it can tracks location and distance whole the app is closed.\n\nWaste of battery and heats up the phone.\n\nThe application runs too slowly or crashes on older iPhone models.\n\nAnother suggestion is to only turn on the app when the user is in a crowded place, meeting, dining, where one lingers more than 30min.	0

I followed the battery optimisation prompts when installing and setting up each and every one of the 4 times I have unloaded and reloaded this App. But, it keeps switching off or comes up as Inactive.

I am a key worker, I could potentially come into contact with this virus. And after 14 days it removes data. So that is a lot of potential contact with this virus missed. If it's not going to work and check then why have it installed?	1

563	Failed to get OTP code after several attempts. I had also removed and download the apps again and restart my phone but still failed to get the OTP code to log in.	1
564	The app is essential in these times. However it may be useful to add in a reminder feature so people can opt in to get a notification from the app to remind them to track every day.	1

568	Useless. Uninstalled. I'll reinstall when you make this far more sensitive to be captured. 15 minutes at 1.5m? No wonder you're not getting any information manual tracing doesn't already do. Waste of millions of dollars if you keep it at this level. Sort it out.	1

574	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
575	I'm on the latest version of the app which is using on average over 50% of my daily battery consumption, my Samsung S20 plus constantly feels warm and I've to charge the phone twice a day to keep up.	1
576	nice	0
577	Very good	0
578	Easy to install and activated. Privacy is not an issue as already hundreds of apps including Google tracking us aggressively. This is a good idea to make sure we can minimise the risk of the spread of the virus. I encourage people to install it.	0

595	Thanks for the app! I just changed my phone number, but using the same phone, and the app seems to be working fine. I'm not sure if it is still based on old number or new number, so I just uninstall and install the app again just to be sure.	0

607	Good apps	0
608	Can't load it as OTP not sent, the application drains the battery life and crashes Samsung S9+ . No battery no tracking so it's a fundamental flaw. Requesting access to media and other personal information is just wrong. Other than the fact the app is unusable I like the concept	1

618	Good initiative, but it keeps interfering with my bluetooth earbuds. Spotify, Beyondpod and other music apps keep pausing very 2-3 minutes. Have to restart phone, and don't the app, then everything plays fine.	1
619	Useless	1
620	Really bad experience. Drains the phone	1
621	The app continually crashes. Looking through the reviews it is very difficult to understand how this app has a score of 4.5 when there are page after page of people who can't get it to work!!!	1
622	The scanning is not consistent at all. After some months, scanning failed. The center line scroll up down couldn't scan at all. I have to Uninstall n reinstall, re register again. This is gonna be my 3rd time to do such actions again.	1
623	A well designed app that only collects the minimal data required if you choose to submit it. Set it up, leave Bluetooth on, and forget about it. I've had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity interruptions or battery drain. All good. Galaxy S9+ running up-to-date Android 10.	1
624	Yet to receive any notification	1
625	It doesn't work at all.... Trying for the past 2 days	1
626	Total lack of information. Nobody seems to be running this useless app. Absolute disgrace for the minister in charge of it. Never heard a word from him. No idea if it is used at all or just switched off. A major deceit on the Australian public. Lukily the States are manually doing what this National app was supposed to do.	1
627	Get rid of the notification saying it's running that you cant clear from your screen. Annoying, the app should be a download and forget. Additionally it's a bit amateurish to have a " :) " emoji at the end of the notification. I have deleted app and am not the only one.	1

652	I downloaded the app. I get that someone will notify me if I come into contact with someone who has the app and then tests positive. However, I feel it should give people either daily or weekly updates of places that the person has been and I wonder when two mobile phones that have the app downloaded on the phones - do they react to each other. Another thing is people on the island of ireland both north and south of the island should be able to use both apps together.	1

676	The latest update is consuming huge battery consumption...It was okay till before the latest build. Please check and do the needful.	1
677	Unable to register ...showing exceeded number of activation.....asking to call 109..but no response	1
678	It does what it sets out to do and does it well. Often apps like this feel poorly designed or hastily developed but its not the case here. One feature that I think its missing is the option to set up daily reminders to check in. Not a major setback (and this is usually something I'd hate to have in an app) but it may be a handy way to get check-in numbers to grow steadily.	0
679	Downloaded the fixed app. Clear communication, no issues with rego process now.	0
680	I have installed, registration & viewing the status is good, but its make bluetooth on and makes mobile heat with battery down as soon, please fix the issue.	1

710	Ive been using this since the whole Covid 19 started. Yes a color system would be nice. But beside the point. Why do you need my location for the app to run now? Seems stupid, cause its not like my location is all that important unless im self isolating or required to do so. So to have it needing a location for the app to function is totally unrequired (unless i was self isolating which at this point in time i am not nor do i need to).	1

718	Well done ScaleFocus!\nThis idea comes in 2007 by the American Doctor Larry Brilliant who suggested to create a website with similar idea of logging symptoms before/during an epidemic in order to isolate the virus spread. I am glad that Bulgarian company recreated this idea in such a short time. Hope they could give the rights to other countries ao they could use it in the prevention of Covid19.\nThe app is simple and easy to navigate. Hope they could add more features soon, as for example the personal statistics tab where you could see the history of logged symptoms. \nKeep up the good work! ??	0

726	Kills my phone's battery. Uninstalled.	1
727	EDIT: Apple has released iOS version 12.5 on older devices that now support the Apple/Google Covid tracking framework. \n\nWHEN WILL THIS APP WORK ON OLDER DEVICES?\n\nI have Bluetooth enabled on my phone. Why can’t you invest a bit more time to make it compatible with more devices?  \n\nBased on the reviews I’m not the only person who can’t use it. There are enough idiots in this country ignoring health department directions who won’t install this app.  Please don’t exclude those of us who want to use it. For the health of me and the strangers around me expand support for this app. Or release a second version for older iOS versions.	1

744	OTP that I typed in was correct but app prompted as wrong. My details that I entered are correct, but the app keeps saying "validation failed". What type of lousy app is this? Reinstalled, still having the same issue	1
745	Battery drain like mad and interferes with bt earpiece.	1
746	It can be improved a lot. Please use my cell phone location to show the nearest sample collection booth. Right now, it shows all the BRAC kiosks in Dhaka. No need to show all of them. Show 4-5 of them which are nearest to me. That would be more useful. Also list all the sample collection centers in other districts, not only Dhaka. Thanks!	1
747	The app closes by itself even when I am on bluetooth. Ideally, the app should turn on the moment bluetooth comes on and it shouldn't act like an app but rather in the background. I have to use the app and it gets annoying to deal with the constant turn off.	1
748	Excellent	0
749	I like it	0
750	I support the idea of this app, but like so many others experience, this app just keeps turning off on my android phone even though my settings are all correct. I have tried to reinstall it several times but it still turns off. I have nothing else using Bluetooth. Now we have cases in our community with high risk citizens and there is still no response to any emails nor any update released after months of feedback sent. This is lives we are talking about. PLEASE FIX THIS APP!	0
751	So far very good	0
752	my comments are still like everyone, there is no any feedback feature for users who has been installing and inputing their data into this app. i suggest the developer can give some maps which has detailed information about location of someone who got corona, so users can do physical distancing more effective and efficiently.	1

Call up hotline 109 and the customer service told me to change number. The apps only accept the same number 3 times more then that it will not allowed to register. For this issue i have bought 4 simcard. What kind of apps only accept 3 times to register using same number? This is nonsense. The customer service is not helpful at all they can't do anything on the spot.	1

802	My experience for this app is minus 5. From afternoon around 1pm it disconnected 7 to 8 times even the log in was gone! When developer asked me what is wrong with the app there ain't an error code nor message! Anyway for those that have this issue like me do get your tracetogether token for just in case.	1

806	I download the TraceTogether sg , i fill my detail , cannot proceed & upload no answer , i on my data & bluetooth togethers , i also don't know what the problem ? \ud83d\ude30 very very poor , I deleted second time , I give up very sorry , I used back my token , but some place they not using the token , only use hand phone app \ud83d\ude13	1

819	Would it make sense to add a function to automatically turn off bluetooth tracking when at home or other predetermined location? Switch to WiFi tracking? To save battery...	1
820	I am happy to contribute to society by using the application. It works well on my phone. The only issue I have is that if you push updates the developer should provide a decent change log. It creates trust in an environment where a lot of people feel there is potential for miss use of data.	0

827	I thought i was doing the right thing downloading it. I have since taken it off my phone as it only works if i am closer than 1.5m for 15 mins or longer. This doesnt seem to be how this virus works (Seeing as everyone in the thai restaurant got it!). I know, or have details of everyone I'm closer than 1.5m to. I was also expecting more than 1/20 of the population to install it so it may have been somewhat more effective!!	1

841	25/07/2020, latest update, Warning in Notifications: NOT WORKING, but when app is opened, says it's OK??????? ORIGINAL4* REVIEW: Found, downloaded and installed OK, verified with phone number/pin etc. The Covid Safe icon is on my taskbar and notifications drop down. Clicking on notification opens App, but actual App icon on my "Desktop" or homepage is not available. If this app works as designed it should be an invaluable tool in contacts tracing of infected people.	1

875	The app states tracing active, that you can close the app with tracing remaining active. If you leave the app closed for a longer period of time 6-8 hours and reopen it says tracing is not active for a few seconds, so cannot be sure that tracing has remained active the entire duration.	1

893	Want to learn	0
894	After the developer replied, I see now that it's a nice Idea, and that it works fine, just not as I expected, i have two confirmed cases in my building and another one in my classroom but this app showed nothing even after two weeks. It seems it is to protect the affected IDs and keep cases anonymous, so it will only show an alert if I cross with someone I don't know at a public place, which is good overall.	0
895	Registering is frustrating. And why does this app require access to private information such as gallery and media?	1
896	I went to bed before middle night. When I wake up and check, 24 contact today. Does the data make sense?	1
897	But does it work in provinces other than Ontario? The website says it’s only available for Ontario but others can download it anyways?	1
898	Overall this app is good but one hour is not enough for medical.	0
899	Installed the app, then Chrome web browser started to redirect me to sites that potentially have malware .	1
900	Very ordinary. My Bluetooth turns off and it never prompts. Often isn't running. Basically a dud app and of little use. And I use android.apple is a total fail	1
901	Another nonsense from our government... This app is Just spreading the fake rumors. In reality, covid19 is gone (a long ago) but this \ud83d\udc29 is still showing new cases. Try to understand your responsibility and try to show the reality, not reality show.	1
902	Doesn't send activation code when foreign country code is used.	1
903	It works only to trace my phone battery .\nIt traces so well, it drains my phone battery  in a few hours.\nGood job on such a useless app\nForcing people to use a badly constructed app is just wrong .	1

914	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
915	Try to download the app numerous times, still cannot. Wonder what is the problem....!!!	1
916	The app makes my phone gets really hot and it causes my other app to crash. Before downloading this app the phone was doing well and does not get hot so fast. Its horrible	1

My wife has just tried to join via her phone and she is getting the same results, invalid phone number. Yes, we have tried dropping the zero as well. Yet my two daughters had no problem completing the join up. Weird.	1

937	Arogya setu app doesn't work correctly with some mobiles/ numbers. 1) I came in contact with covid19 positive few times in office but the app has not shown any risk ever. Always showed as safe and green colour. 2) on 24.11.2020 myself tested covid19 positive by Delhi health care department. Further, I had submitted about tested positive in my mobile app, even then the app shows to me as safe and green. Even My contacts did not get their status risk on my positive test. - Satyanarayana, Delhi.	1

944	Battery needs much charging Burned my finger plugging out charger	1
945	Not working please check	1
946	Do not like the fact that it has access to every aspect of my phone. This is completely unnecessary with regards to reducing the spread of Covid-19. I appreciate the need to know my location at all times, as well as my contacts; other than this there is no feasible explanation for this app needing access to my emails, watsap, phone calls etc etc etc. It is a violation if my privacy.	1
947	Worst app i have never seen. mandatary app doesn't work properly.	1
948	Tks for helping	0
949	Sucks	1
950	The Australian Government pushed everyone to install this, but on iOS it was problematic, yet instead of improving it, or pivoting to create a central check-in register, all businesses in Australia adopted disparate approaches for Covid check-in, thereby hampering covid tracing. At the very least they could have indicated it was a waste of time and told people to uninstall.	1
951	Very much helpful app I love this app And This situation this app is very much importance of this app . I will recommend that every people install this app . And Stay healthy and safe	0

955	Why no attestation certificate option after upgrading!!	1
956	Triple Useless. A person with Covid-19 has to be tested positive (it's almost impossible to get tested in Japan). Then they have to use the app, register their positive status, keep their phone with them and keep the app running at all times (impractical). Finally, "contact" only counts if you're within 1 meter of such a person for at least 15 minutes at one time (an absurdly narrow definition of risk).	1

One day it was showing over 2000 exchange in a day when i was in my house for full day. There is some critical issue with app. I'm using on Samsung Galaxy A70 phone. Please check and resolve soon	1

993	I really want to use this app as it is a great idea. However since installing it, I've had nothing but issues with my phone, issues with updating important apps for work, even battery life is messed up. App can't work without an alive phone, and phone can't stay alive if said app drains it of all power before it has a chance to do anyone any good. So it's a no for me regarding the installation of this app. I stick to what we have been doing since this all started. Keep distance and wash hands.	0

1011	A great App. Everyone should have it on their smartphone for the good of all.	0
1012	observed strange behaviour from this app in the last few hours. devoured battery life and caused the device to heat up noticeably. i've never seen something like that before - uninstalled the app, believing it had been hacked. strange behaviour that warrants investigation. (edit): the phone reports unusually high battery usage by my online banking app during the same period. this looks very dodgy.	1

1021	Excellent, download and get on board the train to normality!	0
1022	keep crash and closing	1
1023	Wouldn't accept phone no.	1
1024	I agree with turning on bluetooth and giving my phone number. I do NOT agree with enabling Location which the app says is compulsory for it to work. This is being misrepresented. If it is only using bluetooth to trace contact with others then Location is not necessary. Enabling Location tells Google where i am which i refuse. This app is probably just part of Five Eyes and other anti-human anti-freedom programs. I cannot recommend this for humans.	1
1025	Very useful	0
1026	This app impacts on my Bluetooth functionality too much. I'm using a pair of BT earbuds and had no issues with them until I start using Tracetogether App. Now the earbuds keeps getting disconnecting and reconnecting which frankly is getting on my nerve.	1

1044	App drains battery too quickly (59% to 53% in 15min of idle) and keeps phone warm when idle on a tabletop. I don't mind helping the government, but not at the expense of my phone's longevity... EDIT: Developer has replied that drain is marginally greater on phones with Bluetooth enabled. But in the first place, your phone's Bluetooth should not be turned on all the time if you you want to save battery!	1

1084	The battery drain is unprecedented. If I want to use only safe entry this app doesn't allow, it needs Bluetooth by default. Instead make it optional, if we are running low on battery at least we can make use of safe entry to check in or out. It is all or nothing at present that is one of the reasons people are reluctant to use it and rue about it.	1

1116	Good app, but needs to add a feature notifying people to check in symptoms daily. Only 10-15% of users are dping this daily as most are forgetting due to a lack of prompting from the app itself.	0
1117	Hi everyone, just to clear up the issue with battery usage - I downloaded the app yesterday and it used about 3-4% battery in a 24 hour period according to my phone's device manager. We are here to use the app for the greater good, and if you are influenced by a few % of battery which most of the day you have access to a charger, I strongly consider you have a look at your reasoning. These comments where people are whinging about draining their entire battery is false and absolutely not helpful	1
1118	Do we need to pay charges for this app once we download it.plz let me know	1
1119	No option for Visit Visas holders.	1

EDIT... new data is great. Downside... Seems that with my location and bluetooth enabled this app seriously drains my phones battery.

Had to repeatedly attempt to scan 10+ times before it worked. Drained 25% of battery in 2hrs+. New Samsung Galaxy S20+ with latest firmware still have this issue. Update 23 Oct - Just noticed the app asks for permissions to know precise location and to read contents of storage card. WTH????	1

1175	It's written it needs Bluetooth ON all the time, Ok for that, it's the way it works. But it also requests GPS autorisation to be ON all the time, leaving other apps to potentially drain battery! Disappointed that the government together with our polytechnic schools weren't able to make something clean. Only reason to accept it is for protecting society.	1
1176	Easy to set up. Does NOT interfere with any other Bluetooth devices I connect to (car, ear pods etc) Have not noticed any difference at all in battery useage. (Samsung phone, Optus network)	1

1195	Bluetooth/BTLE technology was not designed as used by the app designers. No coordination with OS vendor Google. Very inefficient design and low compatibility to wide range of Android OS devices . Security and safety has yet to be proven for the app as it has not been peer reviewed by non-Singapore based Security researchers for infosec purposes .	1
1196	Easy to set up. I had no issues. If by downloading the app restrictions get lifted earlier I think it is worthwhile. Plus as the one who does the shopping I like the idea of knowing if I have been in contact with someone who has it.	0

1200	Massive battery drain and Bluetooth issues made phone unusable. Great idea, poor coding. If the Government wants this app to do it's job, then don't let a 2 yr old do the encoding. Tried on 2 different handsets from different brands. Issues same across both devices. Want more Australians to use it? Then fix the damn bugs. I will not be reinstalling for a third time until issues are fixed.	1
1201	My father was covid 19 positive Still app show that no exposure covid 19 positive	1
1202	The app forces you to always keep your location turned on, and you should allow it to access media, to manage and make calls, and once you access the app, it askes to turn on the Bluetooth, Just what kind of an IT did this app? Who allows to have their personal space taken away? Based on what I MUST allow it so it works? Assume I don't want to allow it to access my phone personal photos and pictures, then this app will go sad and crying in a corner because I deny its access? And will not work!	1
1203	Doesn't work for my friend iphone 11.. say no network detected ! For Android phone, doesnt have the add family member feature. My friend in the end was stranded outside the cinema. Really unfriendly user app.	1
1204	Unable to get the build in scanner to scan the SafeEntry QR code successfully despite the agency trying to assist me in solving the problem. Not sure if it a mobile phone compatibility issue or the app just don't like the OnePlus phone. I have no issue scanning with SingPass with the same phone. So does that means the scanner use in the Tracetogether app is the culprit?	1

1257	After previously working ok, I started app to use it and it asked for the complex password that had been generated and previously saved. \nApp wouldn’t scan until I had asked for a reset and waited to be emailed back to generate a new one.\n10 digits plus upper & lower case plus a number ensures it’s going to be hard to remember so the phone needs to not forget it.\nAlso no way to check your own movements in case you missed one.	1

1289	This latest version is definitely a much improved version. The downside is still the drain on the battery life. Also is there any plan to incorporate the scanning of QR code? It's nice to have the barcode for scanning but scanning of QR code can be much easier and faster instead.	1

Hence, I have to carry a battery pack with me wherever I go. As my phone ages, I'm sure the battery power will drain much faster. There is no point for this app if users phone batteries cannot last the whole time that they are out and about. Not sure about the privacy portion....	1

I have tried to talk to a human being using one of those lines since 11:00 am (it is now 2:20 pm) and no human being picked up (I tried Mubarak, Adan, West Salmiya, Hawally, Amiri, among others). I only get automated responses, or no answer. When I called 151, no one picked up either. Instead I was put on hold with the Quran on playback for 5 minutes until I hung up. It’s a shame that the ministry of health can’t get people to answer phones during this health pandemic. Very bad administrative capacity from the ministry. So far, app is a waste of memory on my phone.\n\n?? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ?? ?? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????????? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ???? ??????: ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ??????? ?????????	1

Having this app on my phone over the next 12-18m required for a vaccine to be discovered also means charging this phone 2-4x instead of the usual 1-2x per day. This will severely impact the expected life of my phone and also, my usage of it. Please fix these battery issues asap!	1
1351	very useful	0
1352	Can't get the OTP... How to install! The developer state the Huawei Mate 30 cause it. But my bank app have been in mate 30 using OTP got not problem. So... If you want this app as only one app. It is no a good app, key reason is Bluetooth is on even you kill off the app when you are at home. It don't make sense at all to on bluetooth when you are at home!. I will go for the QR scanner better. Plus check out the covid active area will do.	1
1353	not goot	1
1354	Very Annoying	1
1355	Makes your phone vulnerable by exposing its Bluetooth MAC address. Tried decompiling the old app (StopCovid) and found what seems to be plain text server credentials on an XML file. Security needs to be reworked.	1
1356	Perfect app. Quietly doing it's job in the background. Hope some day it will work over the borders too when traveling around. It signalled that I have been in contact with other phones already and that's exactly what it should do.	0
1357	I got to the stage with the PIN, but can't read it from message without minimising the app, which then resets, and needs a new PIN.	1
1358	Easy to register. Hope lots of people download this app and don't politicize this.	0
1359	easy to connect and view..	0
1360	This app interfere with my Bluetooth earbuds! My earbuds keeps getting disconnected after some time when I turn on trace together app but when I turn off, everything works. I don't know if I can trust but this app is heavily run in your background and it take up so much battery plus with your Bluetooth turn on. I hope you optimise this battery consumption	1

1377	The idea is wonderful, but the problem is that the app drains my battery by 18%! And my phone battery become warm	1
1378	There isn’t an option to sing up to it,it’s asking us to login directly,which of course it isn’t working because we I’m not yet signed up for me to log in,so how can we use the application if we even can’t get registered?!	1
1379	No English language, as always in Poland! Considering he fact that a lot of foreigner people lives in Poland, is wouldn't be so hard to put English!	1

1404	How does the info get into the phones ? Does it require the person who tested positive to VOLUNTARILY enter it in their phone with the app? No ones doing that. If they test positive public health or the government should be able to enter it automatically through that persons carrier.\n\nNo one who tests positive is entering it.	1

1416	Hey, this is cool and all... but it needs an off button - I come home often, because I am self-isolating, but this is only useful when interacting with the community, so can you please give me a way of turning this off when I am home? At this point, I basically have to uninstall this every time I come home, just to shut up the notifications.	1

1428	Seems fine and not much battery drain. However, can't say if it works and if it's efficient since too few people have installed the app. Welcome to the new era where Emocracy rhymes with Trumpidity of the mass.	0

1462	Not feasible in our current context. Please try for better feasible solution. This thing is not as simple as this suggests.	1
1463	Not sure it is working properly. Everytime I decide to check in on the app, it says battery optimiser is on and it's not working. I then put this on but it goes back to off again. Also there is no way in settings to make sure this app doesn't get this treatment. Ahh!!	1
1464	Totally useless . I am an goverment worker . I am a ambulance driver . And do to corona i carry corona positive and non potisive both but never ever it gives notification . My bluetooht is all always open . I don't no whats the problem . Totally useless ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‘ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜¾	0

Other than these issues, everything is fine and would you bring dark mode back? Edit: Bluetooth connectivity of my devices are having intermittent drops here and there. No improvement for bluetooth stability at all. Each update is getting worse	1

1471	Extremely disappointed. More than 3 months since my initial feedback that the QR code scanning does not work on the Redmi 10x Pro phone and it remained unfixed after 3 new releases since then.

1485	Excellent step by Australian Health Department. Quite easy to register and designed keeping in mind privacy of Individuals. Thank you Australian Health Department for the app.	0
1486	Huge drain on battery, to the point that I have to turn it off while I'm out and about to avoid my phone dying halfway through the day. Which defeats the purpose of the app. Since the last update of the app on my Galaxy s20 the notification prompt which persists is: "covidsafe is not active" although when I open the app is says "covidsafe is active, no further action is required".	1
1487	Since the last update my Bluetooth either won't connect to devices or dropouts constantly on devices I have never had issues with. Update soon or I will remove the so forever.	1

1515	Just one little improvement ?? Could the App actually give more details on Covid-19 symptoms. "I'm good, no symptoms" sounds a bit too casual without the details of possible symptoms. Sounds like this app was written by some wannabe cool kid (who has failed miserably).	1
1516	Very bad too much problem	1

Worse yet, I'd have no clue which bus route i was on or which train or carriage i would have been in, as there are multiple options from point A to B. Doing my bit, but disappointed	1

1633	Although i got an error message saying the otp was wrong, when i clicked 'resend otp' it lets me proceed with the rest of the setup and the app is now working for me. In case u get the same issue, try this trick. App may have setup issues for some of us, but not everyone gets these issues, so try the app for urself. Let's aim to get as many pple on the app as possible so it can keep us all safe & stop covid-19 without shutting down our city.	1
1634	Senseless. "Turn on your satellite positioning system in order to use Bluetooth". This is after months of promising that the satellite positioning system would not be a prerequisite to use the app. A good cause and effort deeply stained by lies.	1

1658	The worst app at all. Your full battery will be finished within 1 hour. people who are using manual mobile, Blackberry mobile or low internal spaced mobile then they couldn't register. Can run this app in different mobiles with the same ID at once so the covid 19 affected person also can carry and go anywhere with the green coded apps by others name. Many people have finished their visa and waiting for the flight to be opened so they also cannot register.	1

1709	If this is designed to work north and south of the border (which it appears to be) then it really needs to have the northern 6 counties included in the county breakdown. The UK government attempt at an app fell on its face (as much of what they do seems to) which means us northerners need to be included in the island wide effort to try to keep our numbers down and nowhere near the ridiculous levels across the water as they pursue a policy of herd immunity no matter what they say they are doing.	0

1766	This was not difficult to find, like a lot of reviews are saying. 3 clicks and I was here. Clicked BBC News app, clicked on the COVID tracing app article, clicked the direct link in the article. Here's hopong lots of people take it on board and use it properly.	0

1768	The application keep crashing even though I reinstalled it on my phone twice \ud83e\udd37 I notice this happened after the update on April 20th, that's too bad tho. I hope the developer could improve the bug so majority of citizen could use this app. Especially since this is coming from a join project between Telkom and Kominfo that I assume is a large scale.	1

1779	App doesn\u2019t seem to be working in the background, as I keep receiving reminders about it.	1
1780	Access only if you give personal data. Why do I have to share my phone number to activate it and then give your Turkish ID number. For the function of the app it's not necessary at all! Take an example from Corona app in Germany. They can do it without data collection.	1
1781	Good	0
1782	This app needs to work with battery optimisation on, I get better battery life with battery optimisation on, I don't want to charge my phone every 12 hours which seems to be with this app active in background. Please fix	1

1803	Significant issues in the Bluetooth tracking remain unfixed weeks after being reported. I would like this app to succeed, but the response to defects and privacy concerns - and poor communication - makes it hard to trust.	1
1804	The latest versions are good. The Bluetooth technology can reach much further - 100m or more depending on version? Which explains why popular places, though the spot around u is not crowded, would quickly rake up Bluetooth exchanges into 10s and 100s quickly. The count would seem misleading. If MOH can subsequently filter data based on signal strength, wouldn't better to NOT exchange and record other users that are physically not nearby in first place?	1
1805	I dropped the 0 and still saying invalid phone number. Not easy to use at all.	1

1815	Hi, I'm now able to register my mobile #, several OTP codes arrived late. Last one just in time so I'm able to register. I just noticed that there are times when Im listening to music on my mobile that the music gets interrupted and then returns back to normal when using my Bluetooth earbuds. This started when I setup this App. Is this normal?	1

1817	Severe battery drain issue	1
1818	Tried to register. Phone number not valid. Double checked phone number. Gave up.	1
1819	I have tried about 6 times & it keeps saying invalid phone number I have had to the same number for over 20 years.	1
1820	App serves its purpose, but UI/UX is poor. “New check in” and “check out” buttons are the same color and so close together. Resulting in easy accidental check out when multiple check ins are required. Basic UX principle of differentiation.	0
1821	Firstly, this app ABSOLUTELY interrupts wireless Bluetooth audio devices. Every earbud and speaker I've paired with will get distorted audio when it polls/triggers a search of the vicinity. It's so bad that here I am, leaving a 1-star review \u2014 you've got to try it to believe it.	1

1827	unable to download still browsing whole day	1
1828	Excellent work. Thanks to the software developers.	0
1829	A great initiative by our government but the programmers should consider to update the app to run in the background. \n\nI don’t think the older generation is aware that you have to have the phone ON at all times for this app to work and that they should use the “power save mode”. If while having a meal at a restaurant, and your phone’s screen turns off, the app will not work based on the “power save mode” instructions. \n\nIt is also currently unclear if we need to be on the app at such times or can it run while whilst we are on other apps? \n\nI hope the app can improve soonest! \nThank you for working tirelessly in the meantime!	0

1839	Unistalled due to not being able to turn off the notification bar. It interrupts the functionality of the drop down notifications of other other apps. Should be able to run covid app in the background without constant notification showing.	1
1840	Thank you for listening to huawei users. I am pleased to say the app works on huawei p40 pro.	1
1841	I don't understand why the app needs access to my personal files, Bluetooth all the time?	1
1842	Nice	0
1843	Important application. Doesn't use as much battery as I was expecting. If you have an Oppo phone you need to go into phone settings, applications, COVIDSafe to stop to phone from managing the applications power use.	0
1844	I got through the otp section. When it comes to the personal information I can't pass through it, it kept saying that birthday is invalid. Who are you to correct me for my birthday?! What a joke. Can you input a section for people who are currently serving NS? I forget my IC issued date.	1
1845	It doesn't allow users to sign up, the response was that the app is on trial version	1
1846	Battery consumption is unexpectedly high. Need a fix	1
1847	Location cannot be turned off. Privacy-first? This is tracking garbage at its finest. Simple solution: Uninstall. You need to have location services on at any times using this "anonymous" Tracing App. Meaning you will be tracked by 3rd party anyway. There is no way turning it off which is absolutely critical for a "privacy-by-design" application. Useless ??	1
1848	Very good	0
1849	It prompted 'not a valid Singapore number' when i try to register my mobile number.	1

1904	After I changed my HP, I could not register my profile. Kept receiving message that my NRIC is to invalid or my name is invalid. Very frustrating. How can I resolve this problem?	1
1905	The latest update is unstable (frequently hanging) and also no longer shows how many days have past since the last testing date. With the previous version, the user/inspector can easily see how many days have passed since the last COVID19 test. In latest version, if you access the result after some time (4 days in my experience) it will just say "Negative - Expired". In the previous version, it would say "Negative for 4 days"..	1

1918	Os version is 2.4 (latest version with group check-in available) but android version is still 2.3 with non group check-in. It is so convenient with group check-in especially when you are checking in with your family.	1
1919	Regular error 901	1
1920	Doesn't give daily breakdown of new figures, can't check data by area. Eats battery and my phone is hot when the app is running.	1
1921	Good	0
1922	I experienced a few little bugs but was overall happy with this app until the latest update. It now requires my GPS to be on (rather than just requiring location permission) to function. I don't like leaving my GPS on 24/7 and am likely to forget to activate it on the odd occasion I leave the house.	1

1933	This apps kills the fast charging on Samsung A70 and puts the device into a reboot loop after coming into contact with another phone with tracking apps installed.

1965	Complete waste of tax payer money. Typical liberal government paying liberal party donors money for worthless trash. Think this was written by someone in first year of computing at Tafe. Hasn't traced one case.	1
1966	Installing the app requires Android OS 6 onward- so already facing the gap of many in the community having no mobiles- added to this you have to have a recent upgrade which is unrealistic on Android (the most widespread mobile OS)	1

1979	First off, a very great effort by GovTech! This is such a sorely needed app by everyone right now to help with contact tracing of COVID-19 cases. Already tried the app, and it's great! Very un-intrusive and mainly runs in the Background. Really great for me especially since I'm using Bluetooth Earphones daily anyway. Good job GovTech, and let's defeat COVID-19 together!	0
1980	Works as stated, smooth and concise. Bad reviews were just premature downloaders. Unlike facebook or instagram which you no doubt use and tag people in, this is not sharing that type of information with random companies. Delete it once this is over. Even for the safety of those around you, friends family and co-workers. Be responsible.	0
1981	Works as intended.	0
1982	Doesn't serve any purpose. Doesn't notify either if you happen to cross path with someone infected. It's just a formality app. The screening is also useless.	1

1990	Great idea in principle but unfortunately of little practical benefit as not every shop or location has a QR code. First time using the app and out of the 5 places I went to yesterday, only one had a QR code. I ended up recording everything in my notepad, but that doesn’t have the advantage of linking in to the contact tracing of the app.\n\nAn easy fix would be to include an ‘add it manually’ option. Search the business or location by address (using address autocomplete that is already active in the app in the personal details section). Include a manual override if the autocomplete doesn’t quite fit. Then a screen to select date and time in time out. It could even be done live with a button to press on entry and exit.\nAlternatively for even easier input, allow location services to locate address, click to confirm, then have the entry and exit buttons to stamp date/time.\n\nAs it stands, it is of very limited use and will only be able to trace a tiny percentage of crowd activity. I buy into the idea and would love to see a more inclusive app... because I want to be contacted if I have been to a place at risk!	1
1991	Complete your profile step spins forever.	1
1992	Drains battery very fast.	1
1993	I have been waiting for it to download for the past 1 hour. And No, it's not my internet connection. I used my mobile data(M1) and unsuccessful after 15 mins. Just keeps showing "preparing to download" . And I switched to my Wifi (singtel) and it has been preparing for another 15 mins already. I hope you guys can fix this problem.	1

It gets through the process to the point where I agree to continue using the App and then get a message saying 'Sorry we can't cannot complete this process. Check if you have a network connection and try again.' Well, I have a network connection, both WiFi & 4G, Bluetooth is also turned on, and I have tried many times to connect. All other Apps requiring a network connection are working except this one. Useless App for me.	1
2017	I'll suggest the government open up all the electricity power points in public places like bus stop, interchanges, mrt, malls, hdb, everywhere so that we can recharge our phone whenever needed. This app is draining off our phone battery. Seriously, COVID-19 is not a very threatening virus. Media has over played this. Outside SG, everywhere doctors are already coming out to say the virus mortality rate is less than 1%. In SG, out of 58,046 cases only 28 died from it. That's 0.048%! V low!!!	1

2025	Best if can add qr scanning safe entry to it. Then we can just scan in and scan out rather than scan to go web to submit and nobody scan out. Just like office punch card. The app is running all the time might as well add some functionality to it.	1
2026	9/8 - Kept crashing after July 30 update, had to re-install several times before registration would work again. 10/7 - Kept crashing after July Android patches, had to re-install it and is fine now.	1

2076	Please ask telecom operators to send notifications to all users to download and install the app. Wide spread usage is required to get the full benefits. \n\nSupermarkets  may be instructed to let in customers with smartphones to have this app mandatorily.

My only way was through bluetooth but now I can't even use it after I installed this app. I was ok with the app until I needed bluetooth for work and this app is affecting me big time. :( please help rectify this issue. Also please have other languages be available, older generations need this app more and can't english.	1
2100	This app seriously sucks battery life. As it is constantly exchanging data with other phones via bluetooth. It has put me off using the app.	1
2101	Very good and easy app	0
2102	I just installed it now, it doesnt work, even I can't open it, just opens to show some information, when I swipe forward and get to the "risk bölgeler" after passing from this point to the other which I think is (hesap olustur, or something like this) the app stops working. I use android, LG stylus. Thank you.	1
2103	Very good thanks for Qatar government	0
2104	Nothing to work	1
2105	Apart from occasional bugs (cannot check out) I hope they will improve on the followings from user experience:\n\n1) the home screen takes up half of the screen space and won’t scroll away. It also doesn’t offer any useful info apart from showing an image of three persons with active mobile phones. \n\n2) home screen should display a list of all checked-in places, instead of showing just the latest one. This allows users to see at once where have they not checked out yet instead of having to check out one by one.  We really have no time for this especially when our hands are occupied with heavy groceries.	1

2111	the government app	1
2112	Downloaded, no problem with it. Have noticed my battery not lasting as long but only slightly, maybe 1% per hr. If by downloading the app the restrictions are lifted or loosened then definitely happy with a bit of battery loss. Only asks for about 4 bits of info from you, i thought it would ask for more. Everyone please download.	0
2113	For those with Oppo phones, if you keep getting the battery optimisation notification, try this. Click settings - battery - and turn off "smart power saver". Also, click "custom power saver" - scroll down to the "COVIDSafe" app and click it and then click "allow background running". Hope this helps for anyone with Oppo phones giving this a bad review!	1

2115	I tried to install but it say error registering even I received the otp. Tried to uninstall and install again but got the same problem.	1
2116	I noticed that since I've been using the App, my music on my wireless headphones has got intermittent lags. Especially when I'm in the gym or shopping centre. I can confirm this but I think it's whenever the app logs a contact, the music lags. If I played it through the physical earphones there's no problem. So I'm guessing the Bluetooth connection has got something to do with it.	1
2117	I cannot make an account because it says that my IC number is invalid. It does not make sense,how can I IC number be invalid. Please fix your problem.	1
2118	Endlessly fails to work and says that its not connected and then whether it's working or not its constantly draining the battery as it won't allow the phone to go into battery save mode, beyond disappointed!	1

2121	There is a huge and very anoying bug, for some reason your app is causing my device's internet speed to fall dramatically (from 20 mbps to 14 kbps) and no, it's not my router, its not my settings, it's literally just your app. When i installed it, it immediately throttled down my internet speed, and right after i uninstalled it, it immediately jumps back to normal speed. Please fix this, this is not only bothersome, but also suspicious. Saya udah tunggu 5 bulan lebih cuk _-_	1
2122	App was great and installed and verified me very fast without any problems. I hope it helps to get live back to normal asap. Thanks	0

2137	I fully support the principle behind this app and have no issues around privacy whatsoever. The app however has bugs, mine is related to power usage. I normally charge my battery every 2 days or so. This app sucks my battery like no other app I have encountered and my S7 (Android v8.0) starts beeping at me every couple of hours warning of this app's high power drain.

2140	Totally useless app which only shows that the Turkish government doesn't care about the thousands of tourists who have been stranded in Turkey since the beginning of the corona pandemic. It's only in Turkish, it doesn't accept foreign phone numbers so you can't even start using it. The question remains: How will foreigners travel by trains, domestic flights and bus in Turkey in the coming days if it's INPOSSIBLE to use the app for foreign visitors and you can't get a ticket without it ?	1

2160	Even when the phone is not being actively used. Please triage and fix asap since this may cause many people to remove it.	1
2161	No OTP coming yet. Still waiting	1
2162	All good so far. Seems to be running great this time after heating my phone up first time around. Easy to understand and I like the added features of hospital info and county by county.	0

2166	Bluetooth problem exists in all updates	1
2167	Despite entering the correct OTP the App displays a message indicating a wrong OTP was entered. And then, after requesting for a new OTP, the App proceeds indicating the setup is complete without sending a new OTP.	1
2168	Shameful app not working when needed..facing inconvenience	1
2169	Pending is not loading	1
2170	When it 1st launch, this app doesn't drain battery as it indicate. After the new update on the 8th June 20. It drain my battery extremely fast then usual. Development team, do take a deeper look into this. Thanks.	1
2171	Can you make the APK available for download for users who may not have Singapore listed as their home Google play store? Thanks.	1
2172	I am trying to register in my redmi 9, continue a message 'registering' it's not moved to next steps	1
2173	I like the simplicity of the app. Everything is very useful. However it's been draining my battery like a hungry hippo. Just today it already contributed to 34% of the battery usage. Yesterday night I went to sleep with 100% battery. I woke up and the phone was turned off with 0% battery left. I'm using a Samsung Note10+. I check the diagnostics and this app seems to be causing the trouble. So I'm currently 80% sure that I will uninstall this app soon.	1
2174	Still killing my battery several weeks after supposedly being fixed. Not good enough for an app that is so important......!!!	1
2175	Why demand access to all my files and photos? Creepy.	1
2176	This is good app I like it	0

2182	Great idea. Does NOT need location data, it just uses Bluetooth to check other phones nearby. Especially good for those who do not have location data and internet access on all the time. Do it to let us all beat this silly hostage crisis!	0

2184	Super simple and works perfectly now. I couldn't initially register but problems were ironed out very early! Plenty of information on how it works too.	0

2196	There should be current active cases mentioned in app dashboard	1
2197	Couldn't get pass the NRIC. - says invalid Tried reinstalling but still says invalid.	1
2198	Chews up all the battery in my phone would b better if my battery doesn't run out while i am out because the app would b useless without the phone.	1
2199	So it means we have to on our Bluetooth all the time, to this app function?	1
2200	We cannot access Ehteraz app in our mobiles, due to Android version below 6.0 / iOS version below 13. It would be very kind, if Government can bring solution for the Ehteraz app, that can be updated to compatible with any versions of Operating System. Many of the users will be happy and willing to use Ehteraz app and support the country.	1
2201	Easy to download and install	0
2202	Nice app	0
2203	Must have bluetooth on all the time (if you turn off bluetooth the app will stop) also mobile data don't forget to let it change the setting for background mode in Android or you must do it manually. It runs in background mode so no screen just icon top left. Tap on the icon to fill in form. Stays on 24/7. It is in French but Google Translate changes it to English automatically. Running on Doro and Samsung S7 both with Android 7 no problem. You will notice your battery discharge is quicker.	1
2204	Some times take long time to have the result	1
2205	error, the application cannot be opened every time I click the application.	1
2206	Still draining battery even though a fix was supposed to have happened. Have reinstalled, cleared cache...all the stuff that people were advising and I still find it draining. Unfortunately have had to uninstall it again	1
2207	Good app	0
2208	Pls fix. Cant open.	1
2209	Is the battery drain issue STILL not fixed? I appreciate that this was caused by a problem introduced by a Google Play Services update, but surely this should already be addressed by now - it's been several days. My wife's phone was affected, and I had to clear data from Google Play Services to fix that, and it's been fine since, but still... This issue has undermined all your efforts, and it needs to be resolved sooner than this.	1
2210	Had to delete the app, was causing my battery to drain far too quick, was barely getting 4 hours from a full charge where I would usually get 24 hours easily. Also, the final straw was when my phone was reporting battery temperatures of 60 degrees or more while idle. Deleted the app yesterday and everything back to normal. Don't download unless looking for a free handwarmer.	1
2211	....This app activating ; then Blootooth all ways on position is keeping automatically.... This way phone set battery will be losing quickly.... Other wise app doesn't affecting any other problems....	1

2213	Is this app working? Every time I click into the app it says its not active.	1

2217	Interesting, the app doesn't recognise my mobile number I've had for 30 years wow.	1
2218	After update it's not working. When I open app it closed automatically.	1
2219	Good idea but no privacy at all. MOH would know your whereabouts even you are going to pub, nightclub, disco or to sex motel. Should the authorities n developer to consider n suggest whether TraceTogether App to be merged with SafeEntry App as well.	1

2223	After installing my battery life had gone bad overnight idle at home easily 35% gone the following day. When outside just merely 4 hrs not even using the phone much drain from 100% down to 60%. I am using Galaxy Note 10 with OneUI 2.5 and Android 10. I temporarily remove the app to check if the battery massive drain stops. I also have a friend using Samsung Note 9 and have the same issue one tome complain about phone getting hot even not using same as I experince I have also.	1
2224	I've downloaded the app but what now? Do I just wait for the dreaded notification that I've been close to a carrier? How can I be confident that it's working at all? It's a great app but only if I know it's actively workin	1
2225	This is Good Aplication. We can easily view our report in details.	0
2226	Great app in concept. However it will not install on my Moto G5. Keeps telling me at the end of the installation process: "Please check that you have a network connection and try again" I've tried across different networks with all combinations of WiFi and Mobile Data turned on and off. Communication connections are fine with every other app.	0
2227	Installed and launched the app. It asked me to enable bluetooth so I did. Phone frozen, restarted and after 5 min I booted into Safe mode. Quickly uninstalled. This never happened before. Motorola Z2 Play	1

2234	Is a good start for creating this app. However this app force my screen brightness to 0% even I turn off adaptive brightness and manual adjust the brightness to 60%. Is there a way to get around this issue?	1
2235	Excellent	0
2236	Battery running down	1
2237	I'm one of the people who deleted the app due to excessive battery drain. The issue was sorted in conjuction with Google who were involved with the development of the app in the first place. My phone is now back to where it was, giving me just short of two full days on a single charge with normal daily usage. Very happy with the app.	1
2238	Clever, functional, good controls and data management.	0
2239	My phone was scorching, i almost went to buy a new phone as my battery was going from 100% to 15% within 2 hours, it was almost too hot to handle at times.. but i seen that this app was actually the issue, i uninstalled it & now my phone is perfect	1
2240	The idea behind this app is great. However, the way it affects my phone's battery really sucks. Can you guys find a way to make this app consume less battery?	0
2241	Berry good	0
2242	It doesn't work, I do not recommend anyone to download it	1
2243	After update, the app asking for a lot of sensitive personal data. Is this app really from SG Gov? Y cant we use singpass to login? Dont feel comfortable after the news of fake app and key-in so many personal data.	1
2244	Need more improvement, also Don't release it if you don't want public to use it	1
2245	After latest update , error occur that your mobile is rooted , but my mobile not rooted so plz check the update.	1
2246	OK app	0
2247	The new update require users to enter NRIC details and turn the colour of icon red. It does not help in provide confidence in the data security and protection. There should be options for user to decide if they are comfortable with keeping NRIC details in the phone, and explain on the reason for this function.	1

Problem is I still have a notification to self isolate for 14 days. It doesn't count down or even give you a date you should have started.	1

2261	Great innovation to contact tracing. However, from my few days experience, it may affect: 1) Wireless earpiece, connected via bluetooth, to your phone as it may disrupt your music from time to time with 1-2 seconds pause and resume. 2) Battery drainage, usually my phone would last from midnight till the next night but as this app runs in the background it uses up my phone battery and I have to charge it more frequent than I used to.	1

I personally would want to know if I have been near someone at the shops that has been diagnosed with the virus . So that I can get tested and self isolate and protect everyone from getting it from me . It was Easy to Install . Happy to help in some way to prevent people getting seriously sick.	0

2288	The app is pretty good. I've nothing to complain about other than the battery drain, but I realise that there's no way around that. I do think though that there should be an added page on it to show you the current restrictions on place for your location (like the currently locked down counties, Kildare, Louth, and Offaly). It's hard to find one source that tells you everything you need without having to trawl through loads of news stories before getting to official sources	0
2289	Good	0
2290	Great idea, but fatal flaw is that it relies on government humans to intervene. Should be much simpler. Someone identifies in the app that they tested positive and all phones that have been in contact with that phone in past 14 days should be notified. I don't trust these bureaucrats to do this effectively and efficiently	0
2291	Keeps interfering with other Bluetooth connection, eg. Pauses the music on on my Bluetooth connected device. It's so annoying	1

2335	Uninstalled. If you want people to use this, the least you can do is to respect their privacy and their agency. Allow it to be disabled when necessary. Allow it to work without location permissions. You expect people to co-operate when you treat them with such hubris? This is all too typical of the heavy-handed and inconsistent response of this government.	1
2336	When I'm connecting to any of my bluetooth devices for music, it will get interference from this app. Pls do something about it	1
2337	I was advised to upgrade the app. I did so. However, the problem still persists. I have sent a few emails already. The scanner would not allow me to scan any Safe Entry at shops or malls. I had to return to using good old Singpass to get Safe Entry...otherwise I wouldn't get in.	1
2338	This app is good. But the connection may be unstable at some times, which can cause information provided to be inaccurate, and also whether or not you contacted the virus.	1

Pluss it keep messing up my bluetooth headphones. Its convenient in a way where it saves the qr code of freq places. The Cons weight out the pros. Until they fix this i womt be using it.	1
2417	It will be great move if the Govt. make it mandatory to use in the public places.	0
2418	battery draining way too much (coughing and sneazing), phone overheating constantly (fever). looks like my phone is catching the Covid not me. this app needs some serious fixing.	1

2430	I have been using this app from last 3 weeks and have not witnessed any battery issue, as stated by fellow users. The battery consumption is around 1-2% for entire day when I start the day with full charge. This is important for our own well being, so no complains whatsoever.	0

2448	Phone roasting and battery draining suoer quick... where is the fix for this. Installed the app the day it was released. Saturday 8th August received a message to say that an app was draining my battery... did I wish to put to sleep. It was the Covid tracker app. I selected yes. I have since deleted the app and attempted to clear the cache (of which there seems to be a lot?) Phone still very hot and eating the battery.	1

2452	The interface is quite easy to use and i like the nested checkin between establishments. But maybe about 20% it hang when trying to launch and scan while in a mall (both nested and single checkin). It also hang when i use my phone playing games, screen showing option to wait or close app. Hopefully the bugs can be fixed since i foresee we need to checkin up to end of the year or beyond. Im using samsung galaxy A9 (2018 phone).	1

2487	I thought it was running for past 2 months, after what appeared to be successful install but it appears it was not running. May have stopped after last update.

2492	Too many bugs. Even if we reinstalled, still we are facing the same issues. It's not allowing me to enter my credentials like my QID and my mobile number. It's Just showing a Question Mark on the screen. App needs to be updated badly. It seems the App itself is a Big Question mark (?) for people those who are residing in Qatar.	1

2495	I have an updated new iPhone XR, it’s updated with new versions. I have downloaded, and it won’t enable. I have all the settings on correctly. I have contacted apple for support and they have identified it’s not the phone but a problem with the app Itself. I have deleted the app and reinstalled many times and yet you fine folks tell me to now delete app shut off my phone THEN reinstall. I’ve done all of that and IT STIIL DOESNT WORK. A waste of time. I would like to be notified if I’ve been exposed, but this app doesn’t cut it. Just FIX it! Or heck give me a number to call and WORK with me to actually figure it out. Come on guys! You are suppose to be the smart ones. cheers!	1

The first few times I tried it said phone number invalid, however I've just tried again now and worked without any issues - probably just so many people getting on board. Instead of critisizing a great initiative, show some patience and try again in an hour or so...	0

Keeping the Bluetooth on does not interfere with my Bluetooth earpiece (using baseus, cheap brand) nor does it interfere with my car Bluetooth connection. I can still play songs on my phone via Bluetooth while tracetogether is still on. The only improvement I can think of is to show the list of place I've visited instead of the latest one.

2639	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

2654	Had the app installed since early July. In the last week my new phone was being drained with battery power and would have to charge it twice a day. Along with that the screen would heat up, this really annoyed me so I got rid of the app off my phone and immediately the battery power improved. I will not use this app again until I know for certain that it will not harm my phone and that the proof is shown that these major problems have been resolved completely.	1
2655	Relevant for the current corona situation. More people use the better the effectiveness.	0
2656	Some people say that the app is using BLUETOOTH and GPS, of course that is how the CoViD-19 Exposure API works. Apple and Google clearly said that it will use Bluetooth to ping bluetooth signals from your phone to other phones within the Bluetooth Range (kahit i-search mo pa sa Google). So if using this app, PLEASE 'wag nyo i-off ang Bluetooth. It will render the app useless. App is great but I think the developer of the app should team up with DOH to provide some case info kasi based dito sa app wala paraw CoViD cases dito sa amin even though na mayroon na. 3 Stars lang rating ko kasi some data (like ilang taong positive sa isang lugar) are incomplete. Always remember guys to wash our hands, wear face masks and observe social distancing. Together we heal as one!	0

2709	Great sales lady \ud83d\ude1c	1
2710	I deleted after 1 day. Drained my battery real quick.	1
2711	Please add a QR Scan Widget if you are to make this app mandatory. Additionally, since it's not possible to physically be at 2 places at the same time, why doesn't a new "check in" (in a new place) automatically check you from the previous place?	1
2712	this is the app i wanted in this pandemic. I can view the latest count of confirmed, recovered and deaths. also i will know if im i have the symtoms by everyday update of my health status.	0
2713	It tells me it's installed, but I can't see it anywhere. Took numerous attempts to get this far, giving up on it until they sort it out. Why are so many apps only half-finished on release?	1
2714	The app features was really helpful and user friendly	0
2715	can't start always showing " EHTHIRAZ keep stopping" what is the problem without this we can't go outside too so please fix this issues....	1
2716	Good	0
2717	Is good in theory, but the app ALWAYS drops out, continually have to reopen it, have tried everything, restarting phone, deleting Fitbit app, appears you cannot use this app if use Bluetooth for other devices...	1
2718	Vgood	1
2719	Apparently there is a conflict with the German covid app. After disabling it, this one seems to work fine.	1
2720	The app dies when in the background, and thus contact tracing stops. I need to restart it manually when it happens. Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, Android 10.	1

2733	Before I switched phones I couldn't get past the nric validation... now I can't even get past the OTP when trying to set up. Good job... if I weren't required to have this app downloaded on my phone which would be checked during random audits, i would not even install. Good in theory but this app sucks	1
2734	I have tried to register on ehteraz many times but always keep getting 'could not get the api key'...I have tried with different numbers many times and also buy a new phone.but same issue is showing.i called 109 and they were keep telling change mobile number..didn't give me solution.i tried with clear data.clear cache and reinstalled many times...but no solution found..because of this last one week I can't go for job in raslaffan.please give me a solution.	1
2735	Keep crashing after installing	1
2736	Uninstalling. Samsung Galaxy S8. 40% battery usage in one day. Overnight drained full battery to zero. Google Play Services was at 112% battery usage. After uninstalling COVID Tracker, Play Services is back down at 1.1% battery usage. Please fix as I'd like to keep it on my phone.	1

2750	Was running fine for months then, I'm thinking at last update, it kept turning my Location on and draining my battery. I looked into the app and it is not active due to Location turned off. Before I only had to have "Location Permission" turned on for this app... Not the overall location. Not going to turn the Loaction on. I will just leave it inactive. These systems won't work if they're not usable.	1

2757	Good. App. If there was a an app permission like alarm notification that if some covid+ person is within range of 50 to 100m, then it could give a ring or a tone. That would be really helpful. Rest is pretty amazing. Jai Bharat.	0

2765	The application doesn't work! Ever since I arrived today at 7 am, I instantly installed and activated the application, I keep getting notifications that I should check in, however, when I go to heck in, I'm faced with this statement "No check in is required currently" additional the tracking doesn't seem to work even though I gave the application full access to my location all the time. This is rather disappointing and worrying as I keep getting these warning and I can't do anything about it.	1
2766	Reinstalled the app but still Not working	1
2767	Good aap	0
2768	Please fix the app (add the log in thru Facebook option)... I cant log in since i created my account via website ( thru Facebook)... I tried to change password it in chrome but I cant figure it out	1
2769	Still having problems with Bluetooth headsets when this app is working in the background. After the latest update , still bluetooth is intermittent. Have to force stop the app for the problem to disappear. NOTE 9.	1
2770	My mom is using a very old phone model and the "latest update" stopped at android ver 4.x... so we cannot download this app which only supported ver 5.1 above.	1
2771	So so	0
2772	Very informative and helping to withstand and face the COVID-19 Pandemic	0
2773	I don't see why this is mandatory when it functions the same with scanning QR code manually outside malls. Pretty retarded. Unlike SingpassSG app where you could just Check-In to nearby places near your GPS location. Locals do s*ck at making apps and anything tech do they.. lol	1
2774	Keep getting disconnect and connect popup at the bottom of my screen. Submitted an email to feedback about the popup	1
2775	Why not open This app .what happen ?	1
2776	Works perfect for me, even I really hope that I'll never receive a notification.	0
2777	Would be good if this app had a feature that allowed the user to leave details with cafes or restaurants. With 100s of untraceable Covid cases in Vic it seems the app isn't doing what it was supposed to do ...?	1
2778	bhai thank you	0
2779	was ok.. bit wary of the data its collecting by google.. but like other it killed my phone over the weekend! they saying to re-install now but once bitten twice shy!! I'll install it if i know i'm going out for a few hours of more...	1

2784	i'm gr8ful this app was launched for Australians.. it could help to save the elders, or the young & tiny ones of my clan. It could save my friends - & me.. i want to be here with everyone i love when medical science gives us a vaccine.	1
2785	History of QR code favourites section all gone after restoring phone. Will be good if favourite places are saved permanently in profile. Easier for senior citizens who are not familiar with smartphone.	1
2786	Why do we need to update if needed to delete other Apps ?	1
2787	nice	0
2788	Useless app. Zap my battery life from 100% to 0% within 1 hour. Every time I pass by somebody, the Bluetooth function went berserk and start sending proximity signals nonstop. Really funny app worse than Pok\u00e9mon go.	1
2789	Why now its showing question mark ?	1
2790	I am no	1
2791	The concept of this app is good but please fix the requirement that we have to open Bluetooth abd GPS all the time. Espicially for Bluetooth it keeps pop up notification to enable it. It's draining battery + it's uncomfortable to use another app. It should be more user friendly.	1
2792	It's not useful at all because it's not working. Actually i wasted my time for downloading it	1
2793	Just installed the app. Waiting for the OTP to be resend 3 times still no response.	1

2802	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
2803	The app now appears to be working - thanks for your kind attention! When I try to view my test results the app tells me my phone number is not registered, and to log in with a number that is not mine. How can this be, when the initial log-in required my correct phone number! Very frustrating, as we are required to use this app! What are we supposed to do? How do we get our information - to know we are well, and not contagious? This app is a big fail!	0
2804	Works great! Update your phone if you\u2019re having issues.	0

2815	Took many tries before I could activate tracking. Also the ever-present notification is annoying	1
2816	This app is so invasive on privacy, why it access all your phones functions when app says only bluetooth is required. It drains so much power too on old phones. Please fix your app.	1
2817	Makes the phone sooo slooooow that it's unusable. Had to uninstall.	1
2818	Good	0
2819	This thing is a dammed headache!! Frequent crashes and unable to open all the time!! Please do work on it real quick as entry anywhere is banned unless the app is shown!!	1

2821	I think the way this app work and track is very professional, no location service will be used to track the places I visited, just other users who are close to me and using this app.	0
2822	Very impressive and easy to use! QR code recognition is amazing However, it still drains the battery very quickly (Samsung S9)... 3/4 of a day at max. (Thus the "only 3 stars") Would live to have this fixed in order to keep it and not grab a token \ud83d\ude07	1

2878	Superb!!! Simple tech like this should be celebrated and championed. I saw someone mention somewhere that has been "opensource", if it is, and under the GPL, the absolute hats off to our government for doing the right thing!!! One thing I don't quite understand is that we're able to triangulate locations using cell tower data, so why can't that be anonomised and utilised under "emergency health regulations" to ensure that virtually everyone is on board?! Data open, borders filtered!!	0

2888	I hope more people participate in this app. This technology is what helped South Korea achieve one of the world’s fastest recovery rates, despite their initial spike in cases. \n\nPeople keep saying “at least we doing are better than USA” but they have set their bar so low! Is it really a surprise if a person who brought an umbrella to safely commute through a storm is dryer than someone who believes they can avoid being wet just by willing it? Our country should be striving to adopt processes and meet the achievements of successful global leadership, not be complacent with one-upping countries who yet to put in any effort at all...\n\nRe: tracking, this app doesn’t track location with GPS, it monitors proximity to others with your Bluetooth radio.	0

2897	I'd like to be able to turn the app off while I'm driving alone in my car as the Bluetooth pings off other people's app and it causes interruption to my music or GPS sounds. I can't turn off the app through Bluetooth as this is how my phone connects to the car. Its irritating in that way.	1

2910	Unfortunately in light of Govts handling of stopping PUP payments to Irish people teavelling abroad I do not trust the privacy of this app and I habe removed it off my phone.	1
2911	The idea of the app is good. However; The current implemantation method is inefficient since it relays only on the person's reporting of his +ve test result. It should be using the civil ID to synch with MOH records automatically for test results updates.	0
2912	On which basis the app works? If the corona positive patient doesn’t' use phone is it able detect the patient?	0
2913	Easy to use.	0
2914	At least show us the district/area we are currently in, so we will know if the app has detected us in the right/wrong location. I suspect the app only detect the city and not the district.	1

2918	Successfully installed on one phone - all good. Wanted to install on second phone but PlayStore only shows a similar app from the WHO and not this Australian one. There is no choice, just a blue one from the WHO. I do not want anything to do with the corrupt WHO or UN. I wonder how many people download the WHO app by mistake and thereby give their info the WHO. Therefore I although I am very content with the genuine app, I am only giving 1 star to draw attention to what has happened with me. Just realised the android system on the second phone is too old to be able to download the app. The importance of the Android Version number should be made more prominent.	0
2919	This is the way to fight against Covid-19	0
2920	Can the developers come up with a solution to prevent the app from distrupting bluetooth devices connected to the phone?	1
2921	Aps keeps stopping.	1
2922	zindagi ki sabse jhand cheez	1
2923	The initiative of the app was to ensure safety & to protect human beings itself from COVID virus however, the app itself seems to prone to it & infected by Trojan spyware as diagnosed by antivirus softwares. Since, the government has taken a wonderful initiative with a beautiful concept to make people aware about contaminated zones & to avoid physical contacts to ensure safety. So, would request govt to take appropriate action to make it malware free so that we can use it without any concerns.	0
2924	Good until it made my phone overheat. Uninstalling the app did not get it off my phone at that point, so I had to factory reset my phone to get it to stop overheating.	1
2925	Not updating app try to check my last check results... Not updated	1
2926	Very help full	0
2927	Was 5 stars. Now reporting " covidsafe needs location services to work" Not great. You state no tracking.	1
2928	The App will not accept my phone number -in the prescribed format or otherwise-, no matter what I try. I have attempted to un- and re-install a number of times to no avail. I have had this mobile number for at least 15 years and it is my main current number. Should have been properly pre-release tested.	1
2929	It explains thoroughly what it does at the beginning, and then stays out of your way as expected. And our right to privacy is respected!	0
2930	My phone started randomly crashing. Restart, open camera, open restart/power off menu, open Google pay, restart, open camera, restart and so on. It was like the power button was held down. I managed to stop the loop by deactivating Bluetooth which causes an error in the app. Tried some troubleshooting just to be sure then everything was fixed when I uninstalled the app. I'm on Google Pixel 3. Please fix	1

2987	A great idea, but mine doesn\u2019t send me notifications when it\u2019s off (it used to) and you never hear any info in the media about whether it has actually been successful in tracking any cases. The take-up has been poor, hampered by tech and security issues, and I have no real confidence in it but use it anyway.	1

2990	I received the code to alert others only 18h after my positive test result. That's too slow. I understand precautions, but the labs managing the codes seems safe enough and much faster. We can afford a few false positives much better than the delays at the moment. And: no way to copy paste the 9 digit code? C'mon!	1

3118	Failed to install it on my phone (Galaxy J5) Tried it several times and also checked settings to make sure traking/notification is allowed. But it stops at Message "Well done, Tracking is underway" and goes back to "Install App". No Gps Track sign shows up and according to batteryusage Gps-Tacking is not used. Any Ideas why the Installation failed or how I can check if it works (and why then mysterously not showing up Gps-Tracking?) TIA :-) Ps: Gave it 4*rating, because rating is required and as I can not give a review in lack of working app, I judged after the reviews :-)	1

No other apps using bluetooth.	1

3162	The app behaves nice and quiet and doesn't eat your battery. An insight of how many possible contacts the app is keeping track off would be nice to have and would give a reassurance that the app is keeping track of them (and also to point out people/contacts who doesn't have the tracking app installed when the number of contacts didn't increase ;) )	0

3172	As mentioned it is a great app, for those able to get it. I agree with all those that are calling for the app to be more widely available across older devices/operating systems. Very important! Not only is it important for those that might be in the highest risk categories who might benefit most from this app, but also those that are already able download it. The more people using the app the better it will work at serving its cause.	0

3196	First, I like to thank our gov efforts for setting up this app for the contact tracing for COVID-19. However, I feel that more improvement can be done especially for people who are using the app & the token as many of us has collected the token but still need to download the app becuase not all the places are able to scan the token. Second, it would be better if we use the app without using the bluetooth as bluetooth drains up our hp battery quickly. Thanks.	0
3197	Good app	0
3198	The location didnt change if i move.	1
3199	I have a bad experience with this apps, this apps not working in many old phones even iPhone 6 also doesn't support this apps, because apple has stopped updating iOS for iPhone 6 and previous models. This apps only supports latest iOS 13 or above. The developer supposed to think about it that the apps should have work on all types phone. Because of the lockdown many people now jobless & no earning sources, now in this circumstances how is it possible to buy a new phone for labours???	1
3200	Just as all the other negative reviews mentioned, this app is not working properly. I just returned early this morning and aside from the lack of any kind of courtesy (I was asked to check in 6+ times starting from 9:30am) it requests a check in but when I try, it says "a check in is not required at this time" and I continue to get warning messages to check in before it expires. It's nonsense that these issues have yet to be fixed.	1

3206	Honestly everything is running in the background but hopping on and seeing that thumbs up is kinda reassuring.\n\nAlso it’s not a news app or anything having notifications on doesn’t spam you with anything which I gotta admit I was worried about.\n\nHowever I worry that the app can’t work while it’s not in the running apps list, I tend to keep that clear at all times so I’m desperately trying to leave it open.	0
3207	Draining battery on phone warnings to restart phone	1
3208	Can I suggest you setup a colour system, that resets after 2 weeks. Red - When the user has been found infected Orange - When they are awaiting test results. Yellow - When they have exited a Hot Zone (use geo fences to determine if they have entered for more than an hour or so) Green - When all is OK Shops and Border crossings etc could ask them to show the app for extra confirmation	1
3209	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
3210	this makes my battery die really fast help	1
3211	Doesn't send SMS verification code to foreign numbers.	1

Crazy coze we both got Corona second time from a Corona positive person, but the app didn't warn us about meeting someone positive because it no longer worked.. It gives you FALSE security and actualy ENCOURAGES transmission of Coronavirus.

3260	After a few times the application stopped working. I tried to download again with the promised update. Now I cannot download it. I have a Samsung Note 8 smart phone.	1
3261	Too Hot, Hot Damn. I got the "update" to cure the heating problem and it didn't work. But hey its the irish government. What do you expect?	1
3262	Wow	0
3263	App no longer works if location is off and the App website states that Google require this for Bluetooth to work. This contradicts the fact that my other apps use Bluetooth fine w/o location on. Contact tracing does not need to know where I was, just who I contacted. And Google certainly does not need to know where I was. Will be leaving disabled.	1
3264	Good	0
3265	Excellent	0
3266	Bluetooth connection goes crazy with this App installed on my Samsung Note 9. When I try to connect my phone to any of my other Bluetooth devices like my external Bluetooth speaker, then the phone gets into a continuous loop of scanning for Bluetooth devices, connecting and disconnecting. I uninstalled this App and everything is back to normal on my phone.	1
3267	Its not working	1
3268	Useless	1
3269	Okay good	0
3270	This app drains my battery. I've had to uninstall it which is something I don't want to do.	1
3271	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
3272	Excellent	0
3273	I like this app its a good app but i have one question that Is this app tell me that who is infected or suspected.	0
3274	Unfortunately, al hosn app in my phone	1
3275	Latest update require gps location to be on but that info is not included in the update or description. Why has this been added? Also it's a big drain on battery.	1
3276	Absolutely rubbish this app, I cant change the number code to +44, this app is useless!!!!	1
3277	Android version <6.0 don't have this app to install. Some of my workers can't able to install it. Please resolve as soon as possible in order for them to download.	1
3278	I downloaded this app so I wouldn't need to wash my hands so often. So far it's working. 5 stars, would download again.	0

3284	Good application give as more we love u ??? ??? ??? ????	0
3285	This was advice apps to download to check the status of Covid test results BUT unluckily the pop up message "your credentials is wrong". From the beggining of getting schedule to SEHA for the test I've used the same phone number and register to my EID. So, it is confusing, while feeling worried on that result. Any other option to know the result?	1
3286	Repetitive push notifications are annoying, otherwise fine. The app and Bluetooth use bugger all battery. Apparently disabling notifications will disable the app... So my app is disabled	0
3287	The last update 2.4.1 is crushing each time I try to open the application	1
3288	Very nice Wow the wonder apps	0
3289	Keeps chewing up battery and turning off locator then disabling itself.	1
3290	was working fine. please fix the permission error. i need it to access my workplace. i have also emailed the support team but no response.	1
3291	It kept cutting off my Bluetooth connection to other devices such as speaker and ear piece.	1
3292	Please remove the scrolling text in your covid people radius section. its an irritative feature of slow scrolling. Instead of Unnecessary news and large size labels, highlight "how many people near you are covid positive" in big sized text. You highlighted unnecessary things in big text size and necessary things in small text size with unneeded scrolling.	1
3293	I never have my Bluetooth turned on all day cause it drains the battery and is a source for intrusive spyware. This app is useless and will not protect you from the virus as has been witnessed in Singapore, but it's an invaluable tool for the police to watch your every move and maybe even fine you if you breach social distancing rules. The age of tyranny and persecution is amongst us thanks to this virus that was created in a lab.	1
3294	Bhes nath	1
3295	Drained my battery really quickly but other than that easy to use. Sadly I've had to uninstall as it used so much battery.	1

3298	The Gov't had taken a good decision by making this app just to know about the status of the people living in Qatar. But their r some cases where people don't have their Qatar Id cards, becoz when u access the app it asks for Qatar id# and a expiry date than only it starts showing u the status. So humble request to please come up with some solution for it as becoz the Qatar gov't has made it mandatory for every citizens and resident of Qatar to download the app...!!! Hope u answer to query.	0

3307	There is a constant push notification 24/7 to tell you that the ap is running, quite annoying. The government is constantly tooting their horn about how many people have downloaded the app, but this doesn't reflect how many people are still using it.	1
3308	why it's not working.....	1
3309	Doesn't work	1
3310	Thanks for make the app	0
3311	There should be an option to exit this app, when at home. It consumes battery unnecessarily, when the Bluetooth and location is turned off. You should understand there are people out there who do not enable location and Bluetooth unnecessarily, when not in use. I have to stop this app everytime when at home.	1
3312	Had problem logging in. Panel disappeared while keying in PIN. Unable to get another PIN	1
3313	Works as described but last update has messed up my notifications incredibly and i am not only one experiencing this	1

3335	Hi, i'm foreigner who marriaged with Singaporean this march, i just have passport and my LTVP is not yet approved and always got rejected maybe more than 5times, So when i sign up in trace together using passport, the check-in button doesn't show up, there is just share app button. So this app just for who have nric, ltvp, pr, or workpass right? Not for foreigner, i just wanna make sure., anw for this time i always use barcode scan, wanna try tracetogether, but Seems like it doesnt support my id	1
3336	I can barely enter the app. Keeps saying temporarily unavailable when I'm logging in my profile.	1
3337	Works fine for me, easy to setup. Uses Bluetooth but can still use my headset and connect to the car fine. It has access to very little permission wise and Android hasn't recorded it sending any data. Can't see what the fuss is about	0
3338	App only shows status of only people's who uses this app apart from that there is no data available for other cases near your locality. There are 3 positive cases near my locality but it still shows I am safe. And there is no COVID-19 patient near me. It Should also add features like showing cases like zone wise.	1
3339	Easy to download and set up. No issues with power consumption after one week of use.	0
3340	So far it works - but you should offer a TL;DR version of the mandatory introduction (the part of "how the app works", which is very clear for technically inclined people, but could deter some by its length and technicality)	0
3341	Would like if there's push notifications to update how you are feeling if you haven't done so during the day. Just like when you turn off your Bluetooth and Location you get pop ups.	1
3342	Really good app, but i can't figure out how to beat the third phase final boss, the one where Micheál Martin jumps into a Tie Fighter and starts firing platitudes at the Irish public.	0

3345	I installed it even before it hit the news. Cannot remember how I knew about it but then I’m always googling. Yesterday I got my first alert that I have been near somebody that is infected.

3348	Good, no issues	0
3349	Dowloading was smooth, I was hoping to see my results , i was tested in April and had received my results...the app say i have no results. I was hoping to see if anybody near me has positive through the app. I though that was the whole purpose of the app to know it. To keep know whether to stay away from specific location. Kind of disappointed so far. Hopefully there is an update and this app is of some use.	1

3357	The app keeps saying wrong credentials even after I kept logging out and added the mobile number that I provided at the test center. It tells me to log in with some random number. The DHA portal is working fantastically well but this app is giving me issues. I need this problem rectified immediately as I'm a University student and I have my finals on campus coming up soon. If I still have this problem, I wont be able to write my exams. I hope this problem can be solved as soon as possible.	0

3385	App says it "is active" and therefore should be working fine, however for the past 3 days plus today, it also states in the history tab that I have had zero exchanges with other people, which cannot be correct? Please investigate whether last update affected proper functioning as the app will be useless if so. Thanks.	1

3397	The idea is good and people should download it, but my bluetooth has stopped working since I downloaded it, even after I uninstalled it. My phone is now probably stuck in 'Bluetooth Low Energy' mode and won't work for music streaming anymore. Please correct this. I know the app had to be made in a hurry, but still... It pisses me off.	1

3403	Updated and now wont send verification code	1
3404	App keep saying invalid i c nos. How to fix that.	1

3460	Not working on Samsung Galaxy S7 running Android 8. All software updated but get the message Google Exposure Notification API not available for this device. I've cleared Google Play Services cache but the Google Exposure Notification is still greyed out. Not great if you have to have the latest phone for the app to work, especially if this is to be the frontline defence. Many wouldn't even try the methods suggested.	1
3461	A couple of days ago, this app made my phone sick. It had a high temperature and didn't have as much energy as usual. By removing the app it started feeling a lot better, temperature went down, and its stamina returned. Now it's happy out and about.	1
3462	Good for current situation	0
3463	Clean, clear and unobtrusive. Well done.	0

3472	No option to turn off app when not in use. Huge battery drain. Who would have bluetooth enabled always? Regardless of your internal testing and statistics, basing your data on the consumption % displayed on a Samsung phone is not the correct way. It is a known fact that the battery consumption is not accurate and you did not consider the consumption by bluetooth radio in your faq.	1

3477	Good	0
3478	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

3488	Like all android users here I experienced battery drain over the weekend it was so bad that 4 cores were running at 100% with nothing running causing the phone to physically overheat. After 3hours dead battery Had to factory restore the phone as deleting and uninstalling the app had no effect.

3510	Nowadays the app keep showing "connected to null", "disconnected from null" labels whether using the app or not. After turning off the Bluetooth, these messages disappear. I'm using Samsung phone. Not sure if anyone facing this issue. No such problem in previous versions.	1
3511	Worst App ever	1

3519	Nice	0
3520	Simple & private. This app does all its intended for, and from what I can tell by reading the detail, covers my security. If anyone's wondering, no location services are used (though because of android the permission must be granted along with Bluetooth), and only encoded information after "hand-shaking" a known case are you offered to send your information to a server. There is a +61 to adding your phone number, which may seem irritating, but is not too uncommon in a lot of forms these days.	0
3521	Nice apps	0
3522	I love it!!	0
3523	It started lagging a few days after I downloaded it, also it drained my phones battery.	1
3524	Good	0
3525	Very poorly setup app. Interferes with other Bluetooth devices (headphones, watches, car interface). Shut-down at least a couple of times a day. And have noticed an increased drain on the battery. Not recommended. Uninstalling	1
3526	No impact to phone operation. No battery drain. Bluetooth works fine with other accessories while this is on. Other than the icon, you wouldn't know it was on.	0
3527	Very simple and easy to operate	0
3528	The app is not working, please fix it urgently	1

3530	Easy to install and simple to understand.	0
3531	This Covid 19 app is showing problem as it doesn't open and shows a msg that "server is not responding, try again "	1
3532	I enjoy the updates regarding the scanning of the qr code,now it automatically check in once we scanned the code which to me makes sense than being asked to confirm if we want to check in. And the speed of the scan is very satisfying to me, most of the time it can get the qr code before i can aim. The one improvement in my mind is maybe can increase the size of check in and check out. The "Scan QR" and "check out" so i can tap it easier than what it is now.	0
3533	It ia great app ever	0
3534	App keeps closing by itself after sometime (judging from disappearing logo on top of screen). There's some apps that seem to "deactivate" the app, but other times, still is a mystery.	1
3535	My phone fingerprint unlock stopped working after installation. Worked again after uninstall	1
3536	If the app worked we wouldn't be cowering in place.	1
3537	This app causes me so many problems with my Bluetooth speaker, Bluetooth phone to car connection, and Bluetooth wireless headphone to phone connection. Bluetooth signal drops out, very frustrating as one of the main uses for my phone is to listen to media, audio books, podcasts etc using this technology. It's very frustrating and I'm considering deleting the app because of these issues. People will not want to download this app with annoying problems like these that aren't fixed.	1
3538	Stuck at filling in our IC particulars. Always have error. Despite filling all details according to IC. Still telling us verification failed. Check all field. You should check on your end. If still having bug and not ready, dont force people to use this app.	1
3539	Have been trying to get the verification code however not receiving it	1
3540	The current version offers useful statistical information on the pandemics, but the app requires specific codes to declare ourselves previously or currently contaminated, codes which do not exist for those of us who got tested abroad or even contact cases.	1

3555	I think it will be good to include in this app with a simple guide on how to keep the app running in the background. As every smartphones these days are equipped with power saving features that will kill the app after idling for a while to save phone battery consumption. This feature can be deactivated, but not many phone users know how to do it.	1

3562	Very bad aap	1
3563	Apparently my phone number is invalid. Which isn't true.	1
3564	Beware! Using this app prevents Google Play Store from downloading updates to all apps (there is bug in DownloadManager that causes app update downloads to hang at progress up to 100%). In addition, using this app stops push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp, Gmail, MyEnv etc.... that are running in the background. I open WhatsApp to find dozens of new messages when I am running TraceTogether. This behaviour has been observed on both my wife's and my phones.	1
3565	Ok	0
3566	Doesn't work for my friend iphone 11.. say no network detected ! For Android phone, doesnt have the add family member feature. My friend in the end was stranded outside the cinema. Really unfriendly user app.	1

3571	Yes it Keep me up to date to help me look after my family	0
3572	Clicking on the function to scan QR code is less responsive as compared to the previous version. I have to wait for at least 10 seconds to let it load. Not just trying to scan the QR code but even logging out or any other buttons. Please improvise. Thanks	1

3588	It would be great to be able to see the daily figures of new cases and any deaths as well as overall totals. At the moment daily new case figures are just show in a chart with no figures.	1
3589	I'm just installed for office, they pressure me to install and set as to turn *Safe show	1
3590	As others have said already it doesnt seem to stay active unless the app itself is open, that's why it gets a one star review because it's useless as it is. If it is any help to the developers it only seems to stop working once I have put my phone on standby, not sure if it's the same for others. I can't be leaving my phone unlocked 24/7 though while im walking around. It looks nice and I want to do my part to help but until this is sorted its just dead weight.	1

Something, just something to get people to install it. The tin foil sales have went through the roof with this app as "It's a government spy tool" is all I am hearing..

In order for it to work effectively, more people needs to download it. It is not working as it should because people are too worried about 'privacy'. The app is 'contact traCING', not 'personal information traCKING'. Don't blame the app for not working, look at the people that don't have it.	1

3736	As someone who works for one of the manufacturers who built this technology into their operating system, this is one of the cleaner and more simple integration of the features I've personally seen.   The explanation about the privacy is excellent, and the app is very stable and doesn't use a lot of resources to run.  The key is to make sure you take your mobile device with you everywhere to get the full benefit.	0

3786	So far so good	0
3787	Started consuming my battery in just over an hour. For such a critical app and service , it's shocking to see this level of poor programming and testing.	1
3788	Super app	0
3789	Good	0
3790	App works fine, except remove the stupid notification saying that its active that you can't remove, nobody needs to constantly see that ..	0
3791	Disgusting	1
3792	it takes ages to update. waste my battery life	1
3793	Not up to date	1
3794	App was unobtrusive and (I assume) working okay. As of 18/12/20 update, battery usage is regularly over 14% draining the phone. Won't work too well if the phone is flat. Really poor timing coming into Xmas and NY I'll give it a while, but it will have to go if not fixed promptly LG V30+, Android 9	1
3795	Cannot enter phone number. App is joke!	1
3796	Easy to install and register.	0
3797	Draining battery	1
3798	Started causing a lot of battery drain this weekend and had to un install it. It demands to have bluetooth and location on all the time but that's pointless if you're stuck in the house.	1
3799	Keeping me informed ???? thanks for letting me know	0
3800	Will not accept phone number - with or without the '0'	1

3806	Now everyone wear a mask. Really the app's good but wearing (and washing) a reusable mask is actually a practical thing everyone can do to keep the curve going in the direction. This will mean that this app will not be needed that would be a great result.	0
3807	Very dissapointing that location has to be turned on. If it's using bluetooth it should ask for that only. Why it asks for location as well? Disaster from a broad adaptation point of view.	1
3808	Good	0
3809	Daily data update does not work and there is no option/button to invoke update manually. I'm not able to determine if I met someone infected.	1
3810	Excellent	0
3811	Can't use it because I'm in the US.	1
3812	Not I don't want to sign up. At the "Enter your mobile number" page, there is an error verifying phone number. Network error (such as timeout, interrupted connection or unreachable host) has occurred. there is not even a contact details which I could reach out to contact with such incidents..	1
3813	Is 3.4 version available for android phones? Iphone has this latest version that allows group check-in that is similar to the singpass ap.	1

3820	I tried to install and configure this App but its not working , Asking number and OTP each time when I tried to open it. Dont know who is taking care of it, Useless App!!	1
3821	Very good and safety privacy	0
3822	Nice	0
3823	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0
3824	It's not working on android. Closing the app after opening.	1
3825	Corona status is not updating, fake status	1
3826	Need more people to download so it's useful	1
3827	Drastic worst exprnce	1
3828	Its not working. Lots of problem in the location	1
3829	Latest version need	1
3830	Other than a drain on battery, this is a pretty simple app. Bundle together with SafeEntry, it's very useful. Would be great if we can do a offline SafeEntry so that it still works in the event of network outage.	1
3831	Cool in theory, but needs changes to work in practice. I had to update my phone just to download the app. It’s only available in English and French. Many of the people at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 are immigrants or the elderly - many of whom do not have phones released in the past 5 years, and many of whom do not speak English or French as their first language. This app needs to be available for as many people as possible in order for it to work properly, otherwise many infected people will not be able to report their diagnoses. This means getting support from lower iOS levels and adding new languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Punjabi, just to name a few. Many people I know wouldn’t be able to use this app for those reasons, putting themselves and others in danger. Disappointing.	1
3832	I think this app is causing bad connection for my bluetooth ear pcs to my hp. Having bad connection ever since I installed. With the latest update,is getting even worse!	1

3835	I have been trying to create an account for 10 min, first off it shouldn't need to access my files and pictures, access of location is normal. I appreciate the attempt and I wish it was working but it gives me an expired id card notification even though my id card is still valid for 5 more months	1
3836	Same old problems as the very first version it was released. Different brands of Bluetooth earphones/headphones keep on disconnecting especially in crowded places. Mentioned the first version, till now still the same. Think I go get token better. Give up on this app.	1
3837	The idea of developing this app for public concern is good, but while executing any application for public purpose, kindly look into all the possibilities of using app by the citizens without any hindrances, asof now many citizens including me can't able to register the application becoz they are asking QID and it's expiry date, as I am on family visit visa I have my passport and visa .it's my request kindly make an option in the app of putting passport number and it's expiry as we can also use	0
3838	No contacts found in Victoria..all in NSW. Let's call a lemon a lemon.	1

3852	It keeps saying "validation failed" after i keyed in my nric	1
3853	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
3854	The need to reverse engineering whatever changes the made to the app or im delete it as it seriously draining the battery.. I woyld like to use it but am not going to have phone die after 3 or 4 hours instead of 24 plus	1
3855	Good for good	0

3861	Unable to enter date of birth	1
3862	I have called 109 so many times all they do is raise ticket & say the technical team will call back within 72 hours which they haven't. I informed of the urgency and that I have cancelled 3 doctors appointment for my wife but the call centre say we understand but cannot help until the technical team calls back who till date have not cared to call. On my own mobile - keeping the app on is draining my battery very fast.	1
3863	Good app overall. But there is problem in "radious alert" that every new update works good in firt uses and later on it doesn't works. In zone area it doesn't guide clearly. Even that just show notification of "safe zone". Except this error in all updates, this is a good effort and useful App.	0
3864	Bahut achcha	0
3865	Great App!!	0
3866	Very clean and simple app!	0
3867	I downloaded this app but realized it does not make any sense - what are the chances that someone who is positive would actually be kind enough to enter their random code? Sadly the way humanity is today, most people are very self-oriented and concerned with own privacy more than their immediate surroundings and society. \n\nI would be more than happy to have such app if it would alert me and others of potential contact without relying on faith that people would actually volunteer to share their codes. Make it mandatory to share - and that is how we can help control this virus...	1

3870	Super wasting time on waiting for never come OTP number. Maybe developer are still on long weekend vacation during covid. Ha ha ha...	1
3871	Battery Drains a lot. Please fix.	1
3872	Works away well on the phone, app has improved since it's breaking down more data to give a better impression of how things are going. Doesn't log location, instead relying on bluetooth connections and randomly generated ids to figure out close contacts so no worries in terms of personal data collection.	0
3873	Keeps disabling itself...every time my phone sleeps the battery optimisation kicks in and turns off the app. I have followed the Oppo instructions under the help section but still doesn't work. Uninstalling.	1
3874	Bluetooth audio needs to be fixed. Audio constantly cuts off.	1
3875	It made you phone overheat and drained the battery in 4 hours.	1

3878	Great idea, but this is still a totally useless application! After ongoing issues with Bluetooth interuption, location permission issues, constant notifications of not working bla bla. Why would this not be attended to with commitment and urgency? It makes me question if this battery draining waste of memory space app was ever at all considered as a serious tracing tool considering the lack of effort put into making it functional?! I wished this worked and could help keep our community safe!	1
3879	After installing is completed, can't proceed to verify mobile no. No OTP received at all no matter how many times I clicked on "resend".	1
3880	Good	0
3881	App should be downloaded by everyone but only time will tell how effective it really is. Regarding information supplied of confirmed cases by area it only gives each county it would be really good if you could get real time information by area within the county.	0
3882	It's not opening I tried that in 3 phones	1
3883	Pls make a widget to allow us to launch the qr scanner from home screen, thx	1
3884	Every tracer QR doesn’t work. Could be a problem with my phone but other QR scanners work	1
3885	The updated version require location to be turned on. I thought this app doesn't track your movement so why does it requires location. Also my battery drains even faster now with both Bluetooth and location turned on.	1
3886	Good	0
3887	I like Padrig have a xaoimi MI6, Android 9 and this app does not work on it. I get the same message "No connection to internet". They must have tested it on only a small number of models/makes. Useless unless it works across many platforms.	1
3888	I believe that the app will be inefficient. For example I don't carry my phone everywhere I go but no doubt the headmaster mentality of government will in the future impose punishment in some form to make all fall into line . It is dangerous to continually break the spirit of the Australian people . I have down loaded this app to reduce the impact on our economy and for no other reason. All hail scomo .	1

3950	Too much personal information collected. Privacy risk. Non compliant to international standards.	1

3952	I have same opinion as Risto Hunt, it could be much more efficient if it could collaborate through API or smth with Finnish Koronavilkku. Because now if people has positive test in Finland on Monday, he must have ability to inform Hoia users, whom he "contacted" on weekends in Estonia and on-board. 56% of Finns uses app 16% only of Estonians (coincidence???)	1
3953	App keeps telling me that Bluetooth is off even though it is switched on and active. My other Bluetooth devices are working fine, so it isn\u2019t a phone problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail.	1

3993	Installed but there is a constant notification on which can't be disabled - ideally it should run in the background.

4004	Good, would be great if it didn't automatically select your system language. I like English for my setting but not on every single app i use ??.	0
4005	That was probably the easiest App ever to install. Remember to drop the first 0 off your mobile number. If this saves one life it is worth it! Sure it uses data but so does every App and Storecard. Let's beat this virus together Australia!	0
4006	After install coudbt get past the add details page.	1
4007	App interrupt with Bluetooth of my phone to connect with other devices. Kindly do not ask for phone brand and firmware. As I have read in the comments a lot of people are having the same issue. This is likely due to the app constant scanning or connecting to other Bluetooth devices that is causing this? Thus interrupting the devices that the phone is suppose to connect. Which are the Bluetooth devices owned by the phone owner. Purpose solution: scan is enough, there is no need to connect.	1
4008	I have tried as many times but it's not giving me option of entering my details once I click on it it sends bug report every now en often even if I uninstall en download a new one the same issue happens now what's the way forward en yesterday I was denoyyed access to shopping at Lulu hypermarket	1

I call the call centre he juat said wait next check in...i hope they will not block my recidency due to this issue. I have complied but system not working properly.	1
4030	I'm always getting this message that " Turn on your bluetooth" even though it is activated since the beginning Please kindly look into this matter	1
4031	I can install but cannot activate this app. My mobile is an Irish mobile. I have been in France for several months and my phone works perfectly.	1
4032	Too many bug, require bluethoot always on. What for. And always require update apps. When I update it, still show up notifications need update.	1
4033	Nice app	0
4034	Like others have mentioned my contact tracing doesn't work unless the app is open. I close the app and when I check back in there's a red warning sign and I have to reenable contact tracing. I have bluetooth and location services on. I have also checked via my phone settings->google-->Covid and the only time my phone has sought permissions is when I have opened the app and pressed enable (again!). I would like the app to work as it's a great tool!	1

4039	Good and there should be a bell like System in the app so that we know If any corona positive near us. There should be a alert system.	0
4040	It Drains the battery so quickly because the need of enabling Blutooth all the time!!! also why allowing the access to all my contacts whatapp , ..etc many things not reasonable and violates the privacy!!!	1

4055	Any one else seeing a error show up when entering a valid mobile number for Australia?	1
4056	So painless and yet will provide essential tracking for the virus. Well done to the authorities.	1
4057	Simple and straightforward, does what it needs to do, nothing more or less. Multiple independent reports indicate that privacy is adequately protected.	0

4059	Useless just like the current gov	1
4060	This app is draining too much battery charge It's going to damage my phone	1
4061	Would the software be burnt into a chip and incorporate into a handband? If it could - then distribute the handband to all Singaporean and make it mandatory to wear it when leaving the house. No point of wasting time and energy in solving the bluetooth interference with headphones, etc.... The objective is to trace 'closed contact'. It is the effectiveness that counts and it must be abled to seperate data measured at 1 metre distance, 2 metre distance, 3 metre distance, etc..to 10 metre	1
4062	Great app , very fast and easy, useful to be aware from corona	0
4063	Can't select a location without scanning (some locations don't have the QR codes plastered everywhere; need to find) and doesn't allow for group check in at multiple places. In this I much prefer to use the singpass mobile version and I really don't want to switch unless this app can offer these functions at least. The only good use I get out of it is to see if there were possible exposures	1

4069	Very high battery usage from this app over the past number of days. 8% an hour of battery been used by the app. I do turn bluetooth off when I am at home and turn it on again when heading out. But I certainly dont want to be charging my phone 2-3 times a day! Developers can you look into this? As if it continues I will have to uninstall and I'm sure I'm not the only one and more people will follow suit.	1
4070	This app has started devouring my battery in the last 48 hours. Tracking isn't much use if my phone is dead.	1
4071	Keep up the good fight	0

4088	Can't even scan. It only appear a barcode with my name and ic number. That's all. Fake app.	1
4089	Downloaded the Covid Tracker app as soon as it was launched & it seemed to be working fine with no issues until this weekend when my battery drained down from fully charged to 3% in a couple of hours although I hadn't been using my phone. I heard there was a problem with the app so deleted it but just reinstalled it having heard that the app had been updated yesterday & the battery issue was now resolved. Strangely enough when I reinstalled the app the date of the last update is July...	1

4099	Was working fine but since a week A RED QUESTION MARK keeps on showing up even after fulfilling all it's requirements having an updated version ,giving full access to it etc. Have reinstalled it several times.. and no one answers or call backs ever... so What's The Problem? Have they made this app necessary and this ehteraz app is not up to the mark.	1

4103	The app works but it drains my battery extremely fast. I Cam only get 2-3 hours on a fully charged battery even is I don't use my phone for anything else. That is a problem. Hope this can be fixed or I will have to uninstall it to be able to use my phone	1
4104	Can't install	1

4140	Good initiative. However, despite the developer saying battery usage will be "marginally" higher, my personal experience says otherwise. I usually charge my phone first thing in the morning, about 7am. Previously, the battery level will drop to about 60% by 6pm. But with this app, the battery level is at 60% by noon!	1

I did not want to delete it but the apps not going to work if your phone is dead! This needs to be fixed ASAP and assured it won't happen again before ppl can even consider redownloading!	1

4163	Doesn't allow me complete my profile	1
4164	Agree with other users. The app should give a daily/weekly summary advising that you have or haven't been in contact with another user who has tested positive. Just like the ios version does. Other than that, fine.	1
4165	doesn't work can't update	1
4166	Excellent ! No problems right here... Keep going !	0

4172	First version didn't work on my Oppo. Update worked fine BUT interfered with all my other Bluetooth connections. Everytime CovidSafe would scan, it would cut out other connections. I tried a variety of different settings to fix the problem but nothing helped without disabling CovidSafe. Hence, work calls were abruptly ended constantly when using Bluetooth. This is a huge issue for people working from home. I uninstalled it until this is fixed.	1

4179	The app has "network issues" even when I have working wifi and mobile data. Pls fix this. I can't even get an OTP because the app is incapable of detecting an internet connection	1
4180	In latest version 1.0.39, if I disable the location on Android, the logo is green on top left corner, the notification says it's active, but when I open the App itself, it says "COVIDSafe is not active"... Same after rebooting. This is misleading. Please fix this bug.	1
4181	Prevent me from continuing registration on create password section, even my password contains small, large letter, special character, number and length 12, please consider this issue	1
4182	I received a message from SALT recommending that I download the SwissCovid App. \n\nThe message is VERY poorly written (in English).\n\nThe first line says:\n\n“The FOPH’s SwissCovid app informs you if you have been in close contact with an infected person.”\n\nI missed the “if” the first few times I read it and thought I had been in contact with someone who had tested positive.\n\nThe first line of the message should be rewritten to avoid other people misunderstanding like I did.	1

4206	Was working fine till yesterday where it kept crashing, I redownloded it and restarted my phone multiple time but the issue still stands, I couldn't even go to work cuz they don't let you in unless you show the app which is crashing every time I attempt to open it	1

4208	This app is functional and beneficial. However, ever since this has come online, I can't help but notice other devices attempting to connect with mine initiating a passkey authorisation. Now, I know not to authenticate, but I think this may open up new methods for someone with nefarious intentions to gain unauthorised access to devices.	0
4209	I keep getting an error message that my internet connection has issue, even after i reinstall. But if i use singpass safeentry it works - no internet issue I don't know why TraceTogether safeentry is so unstable. It is convenient - no login process needed unlike singpass mobile but always fails me. I just tried to reinstall, and now it refuses to work - i can't get the otp, it says i have a connection issue but all my other apps work fine and can get to the internet \ud83e\udd15	1
4210	Why all over a sudden does the app want permission for my location? I've had the app since the start and that wasn't required then	1
4211	The PIN number for Verification not received so cannot verify and use this important App. Unblocked calls from unknown numbers and then the PIN came through! Installed. Runs but looses permissions frequently.	1
4212	App has been causing problems with my bluetooth headphones, it sometimes causes the bluetooth to turn off mysteriously. The problem will stop once I force stop the tracetogether app, which is something I don't want happening. Other than that it somehow doesn't eat up an insane amount of battery so good job	1

4218	It doesn't the me put in my phone number	1

4258	Dear, I just installed the app and it asks me to share my device's location. I thaught only Bluetooth was used for contact tracking. Is there a way to use the app without sharing device's location?	1
4259	It keeps telling me my mobile phone number is invalid..... in which, I can't proceed to the next step.... I'm sure it will be a good app once these little things are fixed.	1

4276	Assuming that the developers of this app did not intend that gps has to be switched on all the time, this does not shed a good light on Google. Disappointing. Update 12.2020: Unglaublich wie umsetzungsschwach unsere Verwaltung ist. Peinlich.	1
4277	super easy setup process, after which it's pretty much "set it and forget it". No excessive permissions required. Doesn't seem to affect my battery life much.	0
4278	Its showing try again later all the time when i try to take permission......and says location permission required even though location permission is allowed.	1

4294	Very annoying not to have the option of installing the French version. The English version doesn't seem to update most of the data very regularly (some of the figures are a week old!) And it would be interesting to have more personalized data - how many Bluetooth connections made with other phones seems a necessary minimum.	1

4297	Very easy to install. Really nothing else to do once installed. Good for Australia. The one star raters are clearly not to switched on to how apps work.	0
4298	How about putting up the amount of people contacted through this app. I was in close contact with someone who tested positive 5 days ago and no one even contacted them about it so we all paid for private testing. So im getting rid of the this app which only tracks you movements and gives you information you can get anywhere	1
4299	Excelent	0
4300	Great initiative and effort, well done. Sadly my battery life is definitely affected by this app. My Bluetooth connectivity to my watch and headphones is also significantly more problematic. However, during these times we all have to sacrifice, but work towards fixing these (if possible) and make it better experience.	1

4307	Helping my husband (army regular) to download and register the app. App requested for NRIC date of issue for completion of registration. Army guys do not have NRIC with them so it's puzzling why this piece of information is critical for registration. Thumbs down. Update: Yes, of course I read that part. Why make it extra harder for NS servicemen to download and start using this app? If this piece of information is not critical, why request for such information??	1

4314	The idea and goal is good. The design is poor. Why would you need Phone and Storage access? The UI could improve, why would you give a splash screen with the start button? Why don't you just go straight to the main screen? Last, when you post updates, please be more transparent and give more details about the update. Don't just mention "minor bug fixes". Thanks.	0

4343	Had the same battery issue but Clearing Storage in Google Play Services, rebooting the phone and the enabling Contact Tracing in the Covid19 app solves the problem. You will also have to enable Phone Backup again (if used) as this will have been disabled by clearing storage in Google Play Services. Hope this helps. Battery drain for a few days is better than lockdown for weeks.	1

4365	As mentioned in many reviews, this app has a major issue that prevents my Bluetooth headphones hold connection with my phone. I really want to install this app and help to fight the pandemic, but at the moment I had to uninstall it. Very sad, do you guys even test it? Deleting the app from my phone didn't help. But when I deleted it from my wife's phone too, everything is back to normal. Please fix that and I'll install it again.	1
4366	Although i really would like to keep this app for obvious reasons. Unfortunately it has caused my phone to lag and not preform as it had been prior to the installation of this app. If these issues are fixed? I would gladly download again.	1
4367	I haven't noticed any issue with Bluetooth or battery but a recent update has affected the notification area. At the bottom of the list of notifications there is a blank white bar where the excess/overflow notification icons goes. Not sure how else to explain it but if I disable COVIDSafe the problem goes away so it's definitely a problem with the app.	1

4396	The initiative is commendable and the app's serverless architecture itself is great having used firebase thus enabling the quick rollout. But there has been this bug wherein it affects my Bluetooth earbuds (they keep pausing and playing affecting the quality). I tested it out by force stopping the application and the earbuds worked just fine, restarted the app again and had the same issue. I'm still using the app considering the situation at hand. But would be really great if the bug is fixed.	1

4455	I have two complaints: 1. This app drains the battery way too much, it's always the top one that affects my battery even though I don't run it. 2. There's so much permissions that this app have that I am not comfortable of- disabling lock of screen, accesing conract informarions, etc. I just dont know why you'll need those info.	1

4462	Great that we have this app to assist tracing. Would be nice to see the stats and info that the RoI app displays. For the privacy concerns, there are no permissions other than Bluetooth and network access. If you are comfortable using Facebook, TikTok, Twitter etc on your phone, then this app doesn't even compare for privacy implications. You already carry a box of sensors in your pocket already, sending your data in all directions.	0

4537	Why do you need to know date of birth and date of issue of NRIC in order to use this app, if it's purpose is solely for tracing covid-19 contacts?

4586	Nice and simple app. reminds you when you forget to turn on Bluetooth, which is good. I only turn it on when I leave the house, since there's no point in having it running at home while draining my battery. You can force stop the app to 'turn it off' so it won't drain your battery. Just re-open the app to activate it again.	0

4595	App works great ! How about allowing the user to record temperature within the app and allowing express entry without temperature checks if it has already been recorded. This will encourage more people to check their own temperatures and also allow quicker entry into places where there’s usually a queue to check temperature e.g at mall entrances. Thanks !!	0

4656	App seems to work well enough but it’s terrible to try and get working.\nFirstly when you sign up, the email code takes too long to come through and the app doesn’t give you long enough to input the code and this was with gigabit connection speeds. Secondly, when you do a password reset, no code comes through at all. Have checked spam folder and everything and still nothing.	1

4658	How many millions did they get paid for this useless privacy infringement app? You want my data? Ask google for it. Surveillance at its best. Uninstalled it immediately. Didn't even hesitate. This app is so useless I believe they could have paid 10 k for it in Bangladesh and get the same result. Spend that tax payers money , because we have to much anyways right? Simple solution to COVID ? Open clubs, start events open everything which results in mass infections, second wave ahoi !	1

4660	Love app	0
4661	As a developer myself I looked into the security concerns and I was satisified with what I saw. I read the reviews of people describing how it screwed up their Bluetooth connectivity but i thought I'd give it a try anyway hoping that might not happen for me. Well, it stopped my watch from connecting to my phone and it started interfering when my phone was connected to the car. So after 2 days I've given up. I will happily reinstall it once they can fix these issues but not until then	1

4677	This is an excellent idea. I downloaded it at 11am on Sunday 26th April and was able to register right away but an hour later I couldn't register my fathers phone. However it was able to be registered later in evening without any issues. As to privacy the app only uses Bluetooth it does not use any location data. No real time location. I strongly recommend downloading and registering the app it will make a huge difference in the fight against COVID 19! Do it for Australia and your own family!	0
4678	Very good app	0
4679	Works fine for me. For the people saying it goes from not tracking to tracking when they open it. You can test it by closing it and turning Bluetooth off. It should notify you that the app won't work without Bluetooth being enabled.	0

4710	Keeps stopping, no notification. Ver 1.0.17 on Android. It often resets the battery optimisation permission. The app then says it's not active until I set the permission. Happens every few hours. There is no way of knowing it happened... - the green Australian logo with its tick is unchanged. The permanent notification says it's running. But tap on the notification and it says it's not, in fact active. Have filled in the error report but only got an automated reply. Left more details. Nothing.	1

4759	Ever since I installed this app, I've been having many issues with my phone. The battery drains so quickly and the system lags all the time. I prefer using the SingPass app. Can't this app be removed altogether? It makes no sense to download another app when there is an existing app that works perfectly fine. Kindly look into this so that we can have less issues while dealing with this pandemic. Thanks.	1

4761	Good widgets and well thought shortcuts, but it keeps messing up my bluetooth connection with my airpods. everytime i get into a crowded space it makes my airpods go silent. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect it again. It’s a small issue but it can be slightly annoying at times.\n\nNever had this problem of airpods disconnecting before i installed tracetogether.\n\nPlease have an option to login other family members too. It’s annoying to have to open a whole different app because my grandma doesn't have a phone.	1
4762	Please optimise the app for battery. Heavily draining batt life and myself and others are thinking of removing this app if this continues as phone is required work purposes.	1

4773	A useful app that causes slightly more battery usage but anything that helps to contact trace people potentially affected by the Chinese Communist Party Virus (CCP Virus), is worth having as an additional tool to help fight this Chinese biological weapon. If any good that came from this CCP Virus is that it revealed China's true colours & is helping the rest of the world in unititing in worldwide retribution against the CCP. Hopefully this brings a demise to this brutal and authoritarian regime.	1
4774	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0
4775	hi ok	0
4776	I liked the app, it is simple and does provide the necessary information. One thing that needs to be fixed is the notifications for the daily photo requests.. I am not getting the notification and missing to upload them most of the times. Also it would be great to see the date and expected time of self-isolation end test and instructions. Thanks for the good work!	0

4781	Useless app	1
4782	Most doctors and labs don't accept the generated test code in the app. Because of this, my screen remains green, eventhough I came into contact with someone who had COVID. A better way should be to provide a fill-in form to add the code provided by the test centre. If positive tests can not be tracked by the app (even if it is due to the unwillingness of the people that collect the tests), it makes this tool redundant.	1

4826	The intended goal to make people of India aware about the health services that are available to fight Covid-19, and to trace the spread of the virus is good. The intended goal is good, but the app, unfortunately might Not meet the goal fully. Reason? Old Mobile Phone Models do not support the app. So if people are unable to download the app, how will they avail services provided via the app?	0
4827	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz.

Why can\u2019t the Government find a data store of its own that is secured either owned by an Australian based company or at a secure Government location? 3. Why hasn\u2019t the source code been published so that it can be peer reviewed. 4. Why is there a need to enter Registration details when this information should only be entered when required? 5. Why has this been fast tracked when Apple and Google will provide a framework which would be interoperable internationally and will be implemented in such a way that data is decentralised and a external data store is not required. 6. This app will have severe limitations as it needs to be running in foreground, the Apple and Google framework does not require this. 7. Is there\u2019s any evidence that this will provide an effective solution to contact tracing?	1

I might not be sharing my location but I do not accept that it needs location access when it is not necessary. Bluetooth works just fine with location service off. I don't care that smittestop doesn't track my movements, but it enforces everyone to turn on location giving Google and other apps access to my location.	1
4854	Very slow with no results	1
4855	Entered details, was not emailed pin to verify unable to complete the install, two covid apps not sure this is the right one	1

4916	5th June 2020, unable to install TraceTogether, as i am unable to receive the OTP password and unable to complete the installation. to troubleshoot, I had uninstalled and reinstalled TraceTogether but the mobile app (version 2.0.1) is not working.\n\n20200605 , Had tested with WhatsApp mobile app, uninstalled and reinstalled the program and WhatsApp is working perfectly fine\n\nI am using IOS version 13.5.1	1

4923	NEEDS ON/OFF Feature .. No point having it on when I'm home with my wife and daughter it's just chewing up my battery for nothing.. Disabled the App and my battery usage went back normal.. definitely using way more than necessary.	1

4928	After using this for awhile my battery drain pretty fast!! 2hrs of usuage drained from 100% to 40%...	1
4929	Just to let you know, this application really used to work perfect for me and I even gave it 5stars until the latest update after which whenever i launched this application, it closes instantly by displaying a message that "Covid-19 keeps on stopping". Please fix this issue. It really is very exhausting and demotivating. Hope you guys understand. I'll definitely come back to change my review if this problem is fixed. *Update:The bug is finally fixed. Thanks guys, i appreciate your fast service.	1

4944	A noble act if app in a challenging time. I decide to sacrifice some battery life and processing power in our #SGUNITED fight against Covid 19. I would like to see statistic of how many close or near field contact I had made with time stamp. Since the data may eventually be provided to the Government (on request), why not allow us user to review as well?	0

4952	Further improvement needed to minimise drainage of battery. The app is on 24/7 in the background to constantly check whether it is active. I need not to turn it on while inside my home to safe on battery power. Areas for improvement - have a button to turn the app on or off to save battery power - disable the function to constantly checking whether it is active	1

4960	Please improve the apps to have it OFF when not in USE such as at home rather then pause for 8hr as the apps and bluetooth are running the Phone Battery and Data which is a waste of $ as you do not need to trace in at your own HOME	1

4966	Its very informative app	0
4967	Just downloaded the app with no issues. It activated immediately and all the information and instructions are in English - a brilliant translation. I suspect this is because I still have an English provider, although I can't be sure. It's also Open Source, which is a huge plus for me.	0
4968	Battery use is ridiculously high. I'm going to have to remove if it's not fixed soon.	1
4969	This works great for me. Thanks, devs!	0
4970	Good	0
4971	Keeps sending me notifications that don't have any information on them, keeps waking my phone when I lock it and turns the Bluetooth automatically. I appreciate the initiative but it is extremely unecessary for the app to have access to my phone as well as media and storage on the device. Privacy is very important to me as well as others in Qatar and letting the government have access to people's personal data is a bit excessive	1
4972	Very useful and handy app during the lockdown. And support for emergency..	1
4973	Good app	0
4974	this app doesnt work in a HMS mobile.	1
4975	It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.	1
4976	Without any testing launched this app Calendar is not working. As per given date format cannot enter date. This is the very first page of this app and stucked, don't know what on next page	1

4981	Was extremely straightforward to install and register the app. People who seem to be struggling are confused as why the "+61", even though people with roaming plans from other countries might have a different country code. I suspect that the phone number they entered includes the first zero. I recommend that everyone try entering their mobile starting with the 4.	0

5016	After new update we can't sign up, we can't enter date of birth properly, please sort out the issue	1
5017	Using an android, 22 hours after app going live, cannot get the app to validate my mobile number of some years. I know that this was a problem yesterday. My patience is now wearing very thin after several hours trying. Getting to the stage where I just ditch the app. Useless to me, or the govies, if it's not working. Seems to be no were to get help. Edit: The app has finaly accepted my number after (now) after many hours trying yesterday, last night, and this morning, before finaly succeeding.	1

5025	There is a common complaint that users with BT earphones are facing audio stutters with TT app. I faced such issues with my Samsung Note20 Ultra and earphones like Sony WF1000m3, Jabra 65t, and Jabra 75t. Pausing the TT app resolves the issue straight away. (Undeniable proof TT app is interfering with BT audio) I hope you can fixed this common problem. And please don't asked me for info like firmware, software versions etc or give template reply. Please work to resolve the common problem.	1

5033	Japan's contact tracing app is one more layer of safety when it comes to the coronavirus. The app works fine on my Pixel 4.	1
5034	Doesn't work with default settings. You have to change power usage settings. I am pretty sure, that most of the users don't do that and therefor the app is useless.	1
5035	After installing the Trace Together app, my Bluetooth will constantly disconnect when I am in a crowded place (e,g mrt, shopping mall). I will keep getting notification from my Galaxy Watch that it has disconnect from my Oneplus 7T. Wireless earphone will also disconnect constantly. I hope the Bluetooth for the app can be fixed and co-exist with my other devices.	1

5055	Need URGENT help.I cannot even install the app. It gets stop downloading after it is 99% installed. I tried more than 100 times still can't download it . I have to travel somewhere and need this app to be downloaded immediately.	1

5084	There are huge privacy and safety concerns because app pretends to be open source and in reality is just a PWA downloaded from government's servers. Event if we compile it from source, there is no way to verify if huge part downloaded from those servers AT RUNTIME is the same as in the github repository or maliciously modified by authoritarian government.	1
5085	This is the worst app,I know some covid patients nearby leaving few meters away but this app does not show any covid patients nearby and saying that there were no covid patients till 1 km,this app does not contain all the data and don't believe that this app works perfectly on covid 19,people need to know information through other people contactless only, don't think that people are safe whatever this app says and don't keep yourself at risk as this app doesn't contain all the data about covid	1

5145	Why does this app require bluetooth to work when i just want to scan qr code to go buy cai png? Make me angry grrr	1
5146	Fantastic app which will help keep us aussies safe.	0
5147	Make the app to be able to run with location services turned off, since it only uses bluetooth. Why does one's movements need to be tracked using location services? You can still use mobile tower connections and other users' bluetooth connections to trace movements and proximity to others. Just reduce the time it takes to confirm proximity to other users from 15 minutes to a shorter time period. I'm not going to be turning on location services for this App or any other App.	1
5148	My phone not working trace together app	1
5149	Error while Registering. Didnt uninstall the app before it started saying exceeded number of installs. Every time try to register it says error to register before.	1
5150	The app looks fine from a technical perspective, but even as an English speaker the implementation of language settings is awful. As per an interview on news.err.ee it seems it is possible to change the language by changing the operating language of the phone. But, first, this seems entirely counter intuitive and is not standard app design on android. Second, this process is not explained anywhere, either on the app, or in the description on the play store (which is also in English!)	0

5168	I have an Oppo phone and due to the battery optimisation feature on the phone, the app is unable to run. Despite manually disabling this feature multiple times, the phone simply will not allow it to stay off. Also I have had issues with bluetooth connectivity while the app is installed on my phone, It drops out while connected to my bluetooth headphones and occasionally also the bluetooth in my car. Great idea, not so great execution unfortunately.	1

5219	The new update is draining the battery very quickly.	1
5220	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0

5235	Make it available for android 5 and below. Help the older people to stay save too. Our Oppo phones are only 3.5 years old, but have android 5.1.1. I would have to root the phones to upgrade to 6 or better. Wouldn't take that chance it might brick the phones. These Oppo phones are excellent for everything else. Banking apps, Bluetooth etc.	1

At least can turn off Bluetooth when having the app running is useless, that is, while I am at home. We need better than a knee-jerk product to fulfill its purpose and function.

5408	OTP was not sent to verify account	1
5409	App running in background fine on day 1, day 2 and I'm seeing huge battery drain - 45% after 2 hours. Nothing else installed, nothing else updated since yesterday. I'm in the very high risk group, I need this app to work.	1
5410	They have fixed the battery drain, so mabye u should download again because last time I checked were in the middle of a pandemic	1
5411	Is best	0
5412	Happy to help my community	0
5413	Doesn't work when immediately downloaded, but definitely a smart system!	1

5417	Woke up to my phone batter nearly completely drained and overheating. I have had to delete it which is not ideal due to the current climate but the app wouldn't work if my phone is dead when I'm out anyway	1
5418	I cannot even use the app always says sorry temporary unavailable I check all my details it's correct but always display the same thing.. Please check.. Hi I already emailed.. Just waiting for it..	1
5419	why it needs access to data and files ! on iphones it doesn't ask files access but on android its mandatory . i cant share my personal things .. so i cant use the app	1

5425	Nice app	0
5426	I love apps	0
5427	App only checks for exposure keys after I have opened the covid-19 exposure notifications that is hidden away in app & notifications in my phone settings.	1
5428	Surprisingly good. Uses bugger all battery, doesn't interfere with other bluetooth devices. The permanent message is annoying but I have that for my smart watch already so I'm used to it.	0
5429	Good for health care	0
5430	I've only got the app installed to help do my part. Worst app in the history of all apps - since the install I can't update any existing apps, can't install any new apps, battery life is terrible, Bluetooth connections to headphones etc. are flaky, blue light filter doesn't turn on or off automatically, notifications for apps don't come through properly (but when they do, they come through multiple times). I could go on but I'd run of out space in the review!	1
5431	It worked for a few days but then stopped working. The app say it is working fine but when I am going out the counter stays at 0. My fried who is with me sees on the app that she came in close to proximity to 10 pax.	1
5432	I am unable to register. I entered everything correctly when they asked for my details but it shows validation failed for my IC. My dad has the same problem. So we are unable to register.	1
5433	have downloaded it asks if ur over 18 I say yes , then it seems 2 freeze & does nothing?? have uninstalled & reinstalled.... same....	1

5439	I cant log in with my NRIC.	1
5440	Perfect.	0
5441	Get error messages such as try again later to get PIN Or Switch Screen Overlay OFF, how do I do that.	1
5442	For me, this app is completely useless because whenever I sit an inch next to someone, I literally don't get any notifications about covid 19 exposures I might get exposed to.	1
5443	Not open source, so still a doubtful app. But unusual times, calls for unusual measures. Edit... I stand corrected! Thanks, and will definitely going to take a look at this on Git.	0
5444	Not working in my phone	1
5445	Horrible	1
5446	Unable to enter DOB.	1
5447	Faltu aap	1
5448	Very easy to set up. For those struggling with the phone number recognition, do not put in the 0, as it will not recognise your number with the +61 in front of it. Common sense, but two comments already complaining about this.	0
5449	Good	0
5450	Good	0
5451	The QR scanning doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple locations and it always says that it isn't a recognised Safe entry QR code. And the feedback/contact us doesn't work either. So hence my review here. Can't be a phone issue. Singpass and the phone's built in scanner works fine.	1
5452	Good ap	0
5453	Bro it didnt even work. The free indi game made by two men in a 3rd world country could function better than this. Like really?	1

5456	Good for health	0
5457	Does not work. Once i run the app, it does not cross the splash screen	1
5458	It drains battery alot. I have to charge 5-6 times in one day instead of 1 time.	1
5459	This is a generally good application, but there are issues with the push notifications for check-in photos. I've called 444 several times to escalate this concern. Keep up the good work!	0
5460	Error occuring	1
5461	Good	0
5462	There is no history related graphs and a comparison about the old and new cases in the app. Markings of confirmed cases on the map are also not accurate.	1
5463	Unable to proceed with the error message: Too many request. * I appreciate the team's prompt reply and fixing the issue.	1
5464	Don't not open	1
5465	Great app. Can you start pushing this with heavy advertisement on social media + newspapers + billboards please? Only 100k downloads!	0
5466	Massive battery drain on android oneplus 5. Phone getting really hot, i nearly bought a new battery, seemingly a known issues, why did they not tell people about this?	1
5467	Always verifying and can be only open through data plan	1
5468	Remove auto scrolling and display a modal. Change the ui as auto scrolling is irritative.	1
5469	Absolutely abysmal battery usage performance samsung a20 not set to optimised. Allowed background, 1minute of background 13% total usage since 8am @ 1600hrs phone flat, there is no need for the app to wake frequently, it.hasnt even queried the android framework today for key matches. The stop covid ni app uses no where this!	1

5476	Easy. Just do it. Best thing for all of us.	0
5477	I already log out yesterday but it's shows that I was this place today.. I only in at about 9am	1
5478	Good application if its all functions are operational. Only numbers of daily and total infections are there and nothing else. No hospitals or corona patients are visible in app as it is claimed. Apparently due to multiple programming issues.	0
5479	It’s simple and easy to use. There’s no bug and I like how fast this was created for the benefit of our safety. However it would be great if it could work on the background. I constantly forgot to switch the app on when I’m out with others or to work. And when travelling it can be boring for me as I took 1.5 hour to travel to work. But other then that, I try my best to switch it on when I’m out.	0
5480	Can't use my Bluetooth earbuds when listening to music.. Had to uninstall n install... Haiyaaaa	1

5482	Very, very heavy battery drain from the app. My phone has a 30 hr battery life normally - now only 18 max with this app installed.	1
5483	Students cannot login into the app?	1
5484	I am using Safe Entry with Singpass GPS service. Minister has said Trace Together is to be the default. Can u look into incorporating location suggestions using GPS in the app?	1
5485	No show green	1
5486	App keeps turning itself off. Have to constantly open app and allow tracking. Defeats the purpose! I should be able to turn it on and leave it on. So I can be tracked!	1
5487	Can't even get it to download. Server overwhelmed again? If you are reading this message means it is not my internet connection that is problematic.	1
5488	Drains battery very quickly. I understand the motive behind the app but give us more insights as to how the app's permission requirements helps for contact tracing. Please try to make it more effective as soon as possible.	1
5489	I can't even get pass the login screen because citizens have to use their pink ic. At least change it to ez-link or student pass man	1

5497	Great idea and service, execution not so good. My battery on a Samsung S10+ only lasts now to about 5pm (9 hrs) whereas it usually would last double that. I've installed the update today and will test again. /Update/ since updating to the newer release the battery is not badly affected. Increased to 4 stars.	0
5498	Don't wish to see the Australian convid-19 safe symbol on my phone all the time. You know that annoying tick Australian symbol, let alone in the notification bar constantly. Hope in the next update you can remove that feature please!. Remove it!.	1

5502	Apps does not work on my brand new Oppo Reno 2 because my phone has auto lock security which cannot be turned off which mean apps turn off as soon as my screen locks which makes app the useless that my reason for uninstalling!	1
5503	Very good app	0
5504	All worked great in my phone.	0
5505	Battery drain, unable to use or to update. I social distance all the time. Have mixed view on app, good idea to quell fear in anxious or medically challenged individuals, but not everyone in society has access to this kind of technology, so other methods of semi controlling this virus are more effective. As, regards privacy, I have many concerns, with data harvesting. No, app is a 100pc safe, but, I truly suspect that many will, not use this, due to an invasion of Civil Liberties and non clarity	1

5514	This app is nice and fantastic to get daily statistics about Coronavirus. Currently I think it has some bugs that is why it crashes when radius alert function triggers. Some more features can also be included like visual representation of infected cases, deaths and recovered cases from its start to till date. It'll provide helpful information Like trend of new cases and death rate during different situations of lockdown and many more. Thanks and keep it up.	0

5522	The interface is quite easy to use and i like the nested checkin between establishments. But maybe about 20% it hang when trying to launch and scan while in a mall (both nested and single checkin). It also hang when i use my phone playing games, screen showing option to wait or close app. Hopefully the bugs can be fixed since i foresee we need to checkin up to end of the year or beyond. Im using samsung galaxy A9 (2018 phone).	1
5523	I think there is a problem with this app bluetooth ridiculous 500++ exchange when im at home most of them time..	1
5524	Great app but I Cannot upload my photo, just keep loading..	0
5525	Got a new phone. Huawei p40pro. The OTP part just goes on non-stop. No response from there. Developer response to contact them if there r further issues. I can't even get further than OTP. Will fix it in future versions. I say come out with the next version ASAP. When virus spread, it doesn't wait for next version. Imagine a break in contact tracing just because of an App failure.	1
5526	The apps is good but the battery is drained I have to keep my phone the whole day on pawer bank to keep on charging. Plus it's not supported by wifi. It has to be accessed for all kind of network to keep up the update tracking. Please fixed it	1

5530	Have had no end of problems with my phone since downloading this app. When making or receiving calls the screen goes black which means that the keyboard function and dial tone functions cannot be used, even to hang up. Have tried re-installing and still have the same problem. Have contacted the developers only to receive a form email that does not help.	1
5531	Good	0
5532	The app keep on crashing down on my phone lately a lot of people experience this bad function of the app since june 25 2020 please give us way to solve or solve it from your system... it gives us inconvenience since we cannot go places in qatar because our ehteraz does'nt work	1
5533	I can't open the application. It was working properly and showing grean. Today I tried to open but I can't, I uninstall it and unstall it many times, again the same isssue. I can't open the app. At the biginning when unstall it again I allow to everything then wont be open. Please help to solve the issue	1
5534	User-friendly and no battery drain. I didn't have to use the QR code function yet. So much better than the french one lol.	0
5535	Can't work with phone without GMS	1
5536	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

5547	For once the Gov has done a good job in creating an app which is actually privacy-friendly, with strong legal protections to back it up. As a privacy advocate and software developer, this is the first app from the Gov that I'm actually happy to have installed on my phone.	0

5590	Funny government, funny developers, a student can do better with half the budget, using bing for chart? Lol. You guys can't even render chart from data available internationally let alone gathering it. Pakistan... Word of shame.	1
5591	It has a bug in the system becos my phone number doesn't work, but good idea to help SG deal with the COVID-19, so I'll rate it 2 star, I hope it will fix the bug	1

5594	very bad idea. should have just done full lockdown like china. very unhappy and disappointed about the whole situation. should have thought about the foreign workers and given them proper living spaces. heard nurses aren't being compensated and public is ostracizing them when they are outside hospitals, shame on the community!	1
5595	Great job	0
5596	Was excellent. Now drains my phone twice a day	1
5597	A quick install. Easy to understand, and there's nothing to be afraid off. Naysayers take off your tinfoil hats	0
5598	Hopeless tried to register but app kept on telling me my phone number was invalid. I have had the same number for 20 years so have no idea why this app wrong accept. Gave it 1 star because zero wasn't an option	1
5599	The app informs you of the presence of a positive subject around you. IF that person also uses the app, IF they have declared themselves, and IF their app is running. Useless. Worst, the button the stop using it on the user interface DOESN'T WORK. You need to go through the phone settings to delete the application.	0
5600	Good	0
5601	Thank	0
5602	Tried to register, but app cannot even recognise the OTP they sent...twice. And I start getting scam calls on the mobile number which I had used for this app's registration. So much publicity yet what a huge let down.	1
5603	Battery drain issues appear to be fixed, but I'm afraid the damage has already been done... Having it drain a full battery in a few hours flat is a great way to have the entire country delete the app and wipe out all progress in a matter of days. Good job, guys. Really hope this doesn't happen again...	1
5604	Worked well when you follow instructions	0
5605	very good	0
5606	App seems to work fine. Had no issues setting up. Doing my bit to help our country get back on its feet, reduce wait for easing the lockdown restrictions, and get people back into employment/work. Together we can reduce the impact that Covid-19 has on all of us.	0

5613	4/5 because it really needs some kind of optional nag reminder to get people to check in daily as this glimpse of the public health in real time could be vital. Maybe nag after 2 days of no check-ins? Otherwise, stable and reassuring. Kudos to all involved. Pity the Google Play Services fiasco on August 8 drained batteries across the country and undoubtedly caused thousands of people to uninstall this app that required Services to run. This is life & death stuff. Take more care when testing!!	0

5616	I tried to register so many times. But after i fill in the NRIC form and click the NEXT. App shows the message "Temporary unavailable We're really sorry. please try again later" I tried so many times during a few weeks. And even many times I did uninstall and install & try registration. But cannot finish the registration. Is this app no more valid? Is there any tip to solve this issue? --------------- After email conversation, issue was solved. Thanks	1

5619	It keeps requiring me to turn on Bluetooth. Wasting my battery.	1

5628	Until the recent update this app was okay a few gripes mentioned below. Unfortunately It now eats my battery and caused my Bluetooth headphones to be completely out of sync with video! I am going to uninstall it until we get the second wave in Tassie! I also really don't like the permanent icon and status in my notifications bar. Please make this app so that it only notifies me if there is a problem!!!!!!!!	1
5629	Recent abnormal CPU usage Samsung S7 Phone running warm to touch. OS reporting this app is the culprit. Deleted it as reboot didn't solve issue. Another user on S7 reported same thing to me today. Need Support information to be added to app for situations like this.	1

5640	I'm a supporter of the concept but have serious doubts about the utility of this implementation. I've not heard of any positive track and trace outcomes in months. At the same time the current version now drains my battery at about twice the rate of all my other apps combined. The government now has a short time to show cause why this app should be retained, otherwise I plan to uninstall.	1
5641	Very good	0
5642	Pls advise how to connect? I have tried putting all my NRIC details into the system but it keeps telling me to correct the red highlighted - my name!! Pls advise? Thank you	1
5643	Like many others had to uninstall app as over last 2 or so days the drain on battery was excessive, from 100 - 30% in 2 hours. No issue up until that and though app was great. Will install again once issue resolved.	1
5644	Although it was a charge of $0.00, I don\u2019t understand why my bank account had to be pinged . Other free apps you download without the app testing your account details. Makes me suspicious and I don\u2019t want to be.	1

5657	Easy to use, takes a whole two seconds to check in every morning and you only need to turn on your Bluetooth when you're going out. No reason not to download it and do something to help keep our friends and family safe.	0

5701	Still figuring out the app, no battery life impact as promised and no alert as I am keeping safe. But: My weekly exposure report came in with the same timestamps per day. I guess the app doesn't check only 8 times per day if there are other people around me. Or that it checks 8 times during the night if any of my exposures has contracted covid. It's unclear what exposure checks are (bluetooth or server checks) If you need more info I'll gladly provide it. Jef Neefs (Job software tester :-) )	0

5715	So far ok	0
5716	Every time I scanned QR code in many locations (shopping malls & shops), it won't work properly or recognized the QR code maybe due to too many users at one go. Then due to it must use Bluetooth function, battery consumption is very very high. Why can't it be using normal Wifi that Safe Entry is using.... And is so frustrating to keep scanning QR Code & it can't read...Sigh!	1

5729	Latest update for SafeEntry scanning is very convenient! Also like that the app actually saved all your check-in (in stack) so that you can check-out sequentially without scanning the QR code the second time!	0
5730	As a user I would want to know if someone who tests positive has sneezed near me. This takes less than 10 seconds. Not sure why the digital handshake is set at 15 minutes. I would rather it be 2 minutes or less	1

5732	fun app to use! so far i have come into contact with my family members, also have to keep my phone charged the entire day because this app requires bluetooth, location, nfc, wifi, mobile data, flashlight, blue light filter, mobile hotspot, always on display, night mode, edge lighting and sync to be constantly on! Whenever i unplug from the charger, my phone dies within 5 hours. Would totally recommend this app to anyone willing to make your battery run out!\ud83d\udd0b0\ufe0f\u20e3	1

5751	Extremely battery-draining because this app requires Mobile-Data or Wifi, plus Bluetooth AND GPS location to be switched on simultaneously at all times, plus it MUST run in the background without limiting its usage of background system resources.	1
5752	idea is good but execution is awfull. Notification doesn't work and the app doesn't tell you when you were in close contact with an infected person, so you have no idea whether the test you may have done is before or after the incident. For all you know it could have been weeks ago. Apparently the 1 meter radius doesn't work either.	1

5764	Great simple app but uses bluetooth so it is annoying as I don't want my Bluetooth constantly pairing to Bluetooth devices. Also concerned about battery use. First cut so I imagine can definitely be improved further	0
5765	Huge battery drain, my battery usually lasts for a day and after I opened the app it lasted tops 3 hours. The phone was also lagging a lot. Unusable if it's like that.	1

5773	1. Integrate with singpass or myInfo to get personal data. \n2. Let app scan for QR code. During scanning also allows Bluetooth to do its work. \n3. Let app detect location or user to select location in advance to prepare for check in, like what Singpass app used to do. \n4. Let user see which location is still checked in so that checking out is easier.	1

5813	Most recent update is draining the battery on my huawei pro p30 more then ever. Also causing issues connecting to my in car blue tooth system.	1

5828	This app caused problems with Bluetooth devices on my phone not allowing them to connect or dropping out.

5900	Doesnt support basic functionality of SingPass Track and Trace app such as favourite locations nearby. Bluetooth consumption is far too excessive and prevents this being a realistically useful app. QR scan reading is prone to fail.

5942	I got a question mark on my mobile last 2 days when visiting a mall. Was suggested to uninstalled and reinstalled Ehteraz. Still got a question mark. After tried several times, we exceeded number of activation. Suggested to call 109. Called several times to 109. Always suggested that all technician are busy and will be called back within 2 hours. Never got call back. Today again i call 109 they send me one message . Any suggestion to resolve? Thanks and appreciate for any help.	1
5943	Useless. Don't bother. Could not recognise my phone number. Tried with and without the leading zero. My daughter had exactly the same problem. Too bad if you do actually want t o help.	1
5944	It's a good app and I understand this app	0
5945	Only issue is that twice it has stopped and will not allow you to activate. I have had to reinstall to get it to activate.	1
5946	Its infringing on privacy as the APP does not only check or track your location. Its access all data in your phone. Tracking movement is very helpfull but infringing on personal data on the phone is wrong.	1

5950	The app requires an ios update of 13.1, but the iphone 6 do not have that update as yet. Hence, unable to install on that device. Is this a glitch? Any other users having the same issue.	1
5951	Definitely much better after the updates. New features included the numbers of Bluetooth connections made a day and SafeEntry scanning function too. Would be good if it allows us to save/favourite locations (such as MRT/Work places) that we frequent so that it will be more convenient for users to check in and out of places.	0
5952	App was working fine until this latest Herald protocol update and battery is draining faster than ever with the COVIDSafe app being the highest battery app.	1
5953	Can't relate to the complains about a bug. It "bugged" twice for me until I understood that I'd keep my bluetooth on. It deactivates itself if you stop it. More useful than previous app showing statistics and linking to certificate.	1
5954	Cannot scan QR code	1
5955	I got an alert tonight showing close contact on the 26th November.. Problem being the alert only came through when the isolation period ended that being 10th December? Very worrying!	1
5956	this app is messing with my Bluetooth connection for my other devices.	1

5962	Drained my battery in 1 hour just as I was about to head out. Waited half an hour to recharge and then it did the same thing again.	1
5963	I feel very secure using this app	0
5964	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

5984	definitely battery hog app, also the notification is always there even after app closed, it is kind of annoying in term of UI/UX please add mapping radius of infected area/person, we can not know where we have to move out so safety if we don't know their location	1
5985	Pointless, Chinese-tier surveillance application that does absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of the virus. The privacy policy is a joke. Congratulations on opting in to mass surveillance.	1
5986	I installed I started. I accepted the TC .. then I got message "Unfortunately, EHTERAZ has stopped". My mobile screen freezed. Trial so many times for the same result. Shall I buy advance mobile such latest Samsung Note or Iphone? My present mobile is Samsung Note 3, which I love it so much. Right now I uninstalled the aps. Please advice. Thank you.	1
5987	Best if can add qr scanning safe entry to it. Then we can just scan in and scan out rather than scan to go web to submit and nobody scan out. Just like office punch card. The app is running all the time might as well add some functionality to it.	1
5988	The app is not working. Was out and about and the app doesn't pick up any exchanges. It's been like this for 2 or more weeks. Please don't ask me to email screenshot. There has been more then one feed back with similar issue.	1
5989	Nice!	0
5990	App developer should overcome IOS constraints and not use this as an excuse for bad UX.  Should add QR code scanner within App and users just need to scan location QR code like what they do in China.  Buses, MRT, other public transport, supermarkets, and all shops can have individual location QR code to enhance tracing efforts.  Now every business have their own scanning and queuing system and it’s so inconvenient for users.  Why can’t SG Govt have a SG-wide integrated system ?	1
5991	Good initiative. Works well.	0
5992	Has really started draining battery, single biggest battery use of any app on my phone. Really needs to be fixed otherwise people won't install it. I can't have my phone dying while I'm out but it won't last 8 hours of even light usage since the last update. Edit update - battery usage seems to be connected with battery optimisation being switched on. I hadn't realised the app no longer worked with battery optimisation on. Battery usage is ok now I've switched optimisation off.	1
5993	Ll	1
5994	Works fine. No battery drain on my pixel. Do it. You might save someone's life.	0
5995	If you want to encourage people to download this app, then don't cheap out on production. Everytime Android has an update this thing stops working and crash reports keep interrupting my device's normal operation. Had to uninstall. As bad as every other government website or app. Budget production, budget results.	1
5996	Entere EID and phone, but did not receive the activation code. I cannot use anything on the app Need assistance	1

6003	The best app and easy	0
6004	Useless. Interferes with bluetooth calls and disconnects the device. Poor quality software. Nice idea and a good attempt but just not good enough. I really tried to tolerate it but no bug fixes forthcoming. Uninstalled.	1
6005	App is really straight forward to setup and use.	0
6006	Using Blue Tooth is depleting HP battery faster than the developer think.	1
6007	Many 1or 2 star reviews are describing a negative experience. I have a Samsung galaxy S8 (Android phone). The app is not intrusive. It has a tiny icon to let you know it's active (which displays upper left of my screen). Notifications are very minimal! Bluetooth battery usage is small. The government privacy statement (which the government encourages you to read before fully installing the app) is very specific and makes it clear that your data is safe from manipulation.	1

6029	Are we actually still using this? Like what's the point it drains the battery and sure I don't leave the house anyway, also looking at the numbers bearly anyone is using it. Put in like daily check-in rewards like a free chicken roll from centra!	1

6031	its very buggy app, permit doesn't appear, color doesn't change at all. i think its launched without proper QA or maybe issue is in the recent update launch. please check	1
6032	To all you one star raters, when all else fails, RTFM. For the benefit of the uneducated, that means Read the instructions!! At 18:03 on 26/4/20 activation worked perfectly. To the nay-sayers, stop trying to show the world how stupid, selfish and self-centred some Australians can be.	1

6039	The recent update is able to address the problems generated by the previous versions. I almost wanted to uninstall the app. Lucky the update came in time. Ver 2.3.8. The TT is the best when it comes to SafeEntry QR code scanning. Easily detects from a distance. Smooth entry and exit. Hope the subsequent updates will not cause any more issues.	0

6057	The pros: - It registers and automatically checks-in really quickly. - Easy-to-use UI. The cons: - Absolute battery vampire. - Interrupts Bluetooth connection to earbuds. (Goodluck yall. My music was interrupted at least 3 times while typing this review.) Please give us an update on when the disruptions will be fixed. I'm actually contemplating downloading a shady QR scanner over this. (Oops it cut my earbud connection again.)	1

6062	PROPOSAL: CP App is very useful but government should educate to the citizens regarding this system and a citizen service center must be work in every city of Pakistan so that complainants may be send thier allocations properly because helping counter na honay ki waja se peoples complaints kartay he nahi.	1
6063	first installation, it is working properly. after phone booting or re open application its program not open and appear message "program crash...." After had been repaired, you got 5 star from me	0
6064	I agree with others here that the app chews through the battery at an alarming rate. In a given day, it consumed 9% of the battery (compared to screen at 5 %). Very discouraging.	1
6065	I download the app, put my phone number in and it said invalid number. I don't know why but it is so hard to use. Tried many times but still fail	1

6117	After I installed it, it keeps crashing Idk what's wrong !!!?	1
6118	The most unstable app ever made, it fails constantly and without warning. It's only a week since I installed it and yet I have removed and reinstalled it at least twice, just because I know its importance if we have to win against Covid-19. The worse part is, it fails during critical times and apparently there is no fix to this bug. I do not understand how it manages to collect data that way. Once it fails to load the only remedy is to remove and install it again. So much effort ????.	1
6119	Working fine and as expected.	0
6120	Excellent	0
6121	Eats the battery and makes phone go hot, better not have damaged my new phone. All settings were turned on for contact tracing and exposure risk and didn't collate any data for 2 days.

6126	It has an annoying notification that cannot be removed. It also requires the user to turn on the bluetooth for it to work and scan to detect other users which also requires bluetooth to be detectable.	1

6131	Excelent app and very useful. Would be nice to have the app automatically detect updates and alert the user. Now you have to manualy check for updates. It would also be nice to link all paper permits to the app. Some of the depents, do not life with the household and the app should take that into consideration.	0

6141	Battery usage why to high cause app. Phone was over heating deleted it...	1
6142	I think it will be good to include in this app with a simple guide on how to keep the app running in the background. As every smartphones these days are equipped with power saving features that will kill the app after idling for a while to save phone battery consumption. This feature can be deactivated, but not many phone users know how to do it.	1
6143	Thank you for the English version. Not everyone who wants to use the app is fully fluent in Danish and this makes it possible. Having the Gps and Bluetooth on all the time drains battery, but there is probably nothing you can do about it.	0

You already have activation code via SMS, and already asked for full name and identification number, the other 2 pieces of information is unnecessary (something a bank might ask). It's an open invitation to be hacked ...	1
6220	JUST BRAVO	0
6221	My son and I have TPG SIM only plans. At start of circuit breaker, the app does not recognize his mobile number - on trying to register the app. Message states \u201dinvalid number\u201d Adtwr waiting a few weeks, he just tried and found the number is accepted, but he cannot receive any OTP to verify his number. What should we do.. just give up?	1
6222	Today after updating software of my Samsung mobile,Ehteraz started showing big interrogation sign same as mamy users are sharing their experience in comments.I uninstalled and installed the apps again following the guidelines of MOI as given in response to the comments of affected users.	1
6223	So slow.Waste of time.	1
6224	Keeps on causing my screen brightness to lower since it was installed (is it lowering the brightness on purpose to save battery or is the OS lowering cause the app is draining too fast?)	1

6246	Like any other's gov app which is free, this app is. Mediocre, I feel. Still don't know, why should make bluetooth on. It doesn't work on my wife's android.	1
6247	I cant seem to get the otp code after countless tries. Even re-installed it a few times and it still doesnt work.	1
6248	Concerned that the database sits in a datacentre fully owned by a chinese company. Gov needs to ensure privacy can be mathematically assured rather than legally assured	1

6289	Brilliant	0
6290	Easy to install and setup. Close it and it sits in the background. Minimal battery use. Tin foil hat not supplied. Pay no attention to partisan paranoid armchair software engineers.	1

6293	I love this application and its helpful at all times	0
6294	When enable it. Always error.	1
6295	Battery Killer. It's overusing the Google Play Services framework and it consumes a crazy amount of battery, almost 32% of battery usage was from it. I appreciate the commitment to trace and protect us against COVID exposure, but it's of no use if it just drains the battery and you can't even use it.	1

6301	Bad	1
6302	It keeps saying something is wromg again and again and again. Honestly given up on this app lah	1
6303	The new update 15hrs ago is not letting me see the radius alert. Plz fix that. As soon as I click it, the app closes. Plz fix it fast or I'm uninstalling.	1
6304	Overall very simple yet good design, rapid improvements	1
6305	Why this app is not working its show me error again and again .Ten to fifteen times i try to connect with Ehteraz but its still not working. I'm upset bcz of it	1
6306	It is very practical, easy-to-use ... But the oy negativesideisthat the phone number never reply answer back. Please. Let me add that , as for example, there is a difficulty in achieving the check in on time especially. During our lectures or general assembly or other meeting, as e.g. today where we had a General Assembly Meeting of our Dept. Of History Kuwait Uniersity...	1

6310	I am unable to get the otp even after i tried to reinstall a couple of times. What can i do?	1
6311	This app occasionally cuts off Bluetooth devices when it is enabled. It gets annoying very quickly. Occasionally embarrasses you when the music on your phone speaker suddenly plays aloud after temporary disconnect.	1
6312	Easy to install and simple to understand.	0
6313	Why this application is asking permission to access my photos and media. I denied permission and its not opening. Do I need to give permission to work this application	1
6314	You say this app does not use GPS. Then why does it need location permission to operate? Remove it before I report it to Google to get this banned	1
6315	Just time waste	1
6316	The app uses Bluetooth (and a Apple, Google API) to log if you've been near someone else with this app installed. The app does not use GPS and does not know where you met someone, just that you met someone. It stores no information apart from optionally sharing your phone number. Information about who you have met is kept 100% on your phone unless you contract covid and voluntarily decide to share. I have noticed no decrease in battery life while using this app with Bluetooth on all the time.	1
6317	Very very slow and bad	1
6318	Easy to find and install. I cannot understand why people say it is hard to find in the App Store.	0
6319	Great application because it is found in corona patient and total case in india .	0

6327	Great. But please implement search to to check-in feature that SingPass has. Thanks!	0
6328	I like the idea of this app, but it's draining my battery to fast, I have a Samsung note 9, which normally lasts 12hrs with heavy use, from full charge at 7.30am to 3% remaining at 12.30pm, that is not acceptable as I have people on my family with health conditions for whom I must be contactable. So I will have to remove the app from my phone. Maybe when the power usage from the bluetooth is sorted out I will reinstall, I normally do leave bluetooth on, so must be the way this app uses it.	1

6330	Great app. Download and save lives	0

6332	On my 2 samsung S7 Edges, grey imports, flashed from Taiwanese to to Aus Telstra firmware and subsequently updated twice OTA, it works flawlessly. The only reservation I have is American mega giant Amazon holding the data in its cloud, even if the servers are in Aus. I don't trust USA big business and I don't trust Australia's ability when it comes to push versus shove against these people. But the app itself works perfectly.	1

6353	The app needs some revision. It's just spoiling our mobiles. Battery drains off and needs to be charged all the time. And I don't know if only with my mobile, the screen gets open on its own and is slow and pauses while using. More than satisfaction it's being a nuisance. Hope u you all can do some upgrade.	1

6376	An epic battery killer. Constant technical popups not related to the purpose of the app. Tracking turns itself off despite Bluetooth, location and wifi being turned on. And again, uninstalled because it keeps draining my battery in hours.	1
6377	cant register aftet updating my phone 100 times	1
6378	I'm happy to do my bit, but I hate the screen clutter, the message that gets stuck on my notification bar "CovidSafe is scanning to keep you safe". Can't you get rid of this? I hate clutter on my screen and this will make me delete the app sooner than you would like. I will still turn Bluetooth on when I go out, but as soon as infection rates go down I'll delete the app.	0
6379	Keeps showing my information are wrong	1
6380	Every time i open this app after some days its automatically logout.every time we need to login. Before 2 month 4 person i contacted had corona ,but i didn't get any alerts or any notification. i just scan my recent contact details at that time its showing some of the contact person had corona.but i didn't get any alert or anything	1
6381	Good application and good idea. I just updated the app on my phone and I got a problem with the notification which some others have too. It messes up the size of other notifications and I cannot read them. Hopefully you guys can fix it. Other than that no issues	0

I got a password (numeric) but instead of completing the installation, a screen that say "share the app" shows up. I cant skip this step, its "forces" ppl to share n if i dont, i cant skip the step either. N thats it, the installation just stops here. Is the installation complete, i dont know\ud83d\ude25. So whats supposed to happen next... \ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd26??! Did the developing team test run this\ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd14?	1

6399	Very useful and informative	0
6400	Always says something went wrong even though I am registered	1
6401	The app requires permission to access media files and location on my device. I can co relate the reason for location but not media. When only media is declined and location accepted, it does not open and crashes. I guess it needs further development and most importantly, full transparency on its functions to better understand and support its cause.	1
6402	Nice	0
6403	Simple to install, simple to use. I agree with the comments below, you should explain the privacy matter in more details to technically illiterate people. Also, auto activation once or twice a day would make so much sense.	0

6405	Since start of this App when ever i need to go out, i always install and use this. I never face any difficulty for regestiration. Since yesterday when i installed and trying to register i got code when i put this code suddenly appeared this error "Exceeded number of activation code. Please call 109". I called 109 they generate ticket number and said they will call you but i did not recieved any call. Any body have idea how to fix this error. Thanks	0
6406	Battery Drains Fast, why is it asking for storage permission?	1

6410	This is a very nice application. they also have healthy tips for those who are experiencing symptoms..may this pandemic be over and all will be back to normal in Jesus' name	0
6411	Eat battery	1
6412	I suggest everybody uninstalls this app. Running my own sw company I cannot see any justification neither for the original budget nor the approved increase from 2m to 5m. Alone for hosting they claim $800k is required. The app is supposedly storing the data on the device not in the cloud, why would cloud hosting cost that much then? Think yourself... This app should never have costed more than 0.5m to 1m.	1
6413	In put my NRIC, it indicate that it is wrong.... As if i dont know my NRIC number that is with me for 50 years.... Suck thumb...... I decided to uninstall....... Sucks After adivse to key in the issue date.... It is still invalid.... This app sucks	1

6441	No OTP is coming	1
6442	Easy to use and dose not collect much data. Also light on battery. If you use Facebook you have no excuse not to use this app. It should be mandatory. So we all could comeback to at least something similar to normal life.	0

6459	This app doesn't work it's a lie it is made to track people no country in the world has confirmed that covid-19 tracking apps work or have changed anything.	1
6460	Excellent idea but unfortunately this app is not helping because it shows very few cases reported in radius alert. I have observed radius alert from last week that it shows less than 30 cases in Karachi and less than 10 cases in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.	0

6520	Had to delete the app, was causing my battery to drain far too quick, was barely getting 4 hours from a full charge where I would usually get 24 hours easily. Also, the final straw was when my phone was reporting battery temperatures of 60 degrees or more while idle. Deleted the app yesterday and everything back to normal. Don't download unless looking for a free handwarmer.	1
6521	Very poor apps. Dose not working properly. Whole day requesting for registration only. And even u call to hotline 109 to solve the problem. Nothing happen. So this apps is totally worse. \ud83d\udc4e	1
6522	A great app for keeping us safe Wash your hands and keep yourself safe Aussies	0
6523	My main concern is Is the battery life. The phone doesn't survive the whole day when Bluetooth is always on. Other issue is I believe it is interfering with other Bluetooth connected devices such as my fitness watch. I always having issues connecting to it after installing this app. Most of the time i have to restart the phone.. :/ QR code scanning also had some issues. However i received an update to the app. Need to monitor and see.	1

6529	Optimize your app more... Kind of battery hog in my phone, because it was always requesting my location for 13hrs straight... There is no need for that... If you detect that we are not moving, give it a break... It is fine if we are in a trip, but a waste of battery if it isn't.	1

6578	Awful! Since yesterday I've received 13 (!!!) exposures at the same time and place I've never been to! Every time I press no but it returns again!	1
6579	The application stops at the very beginning. Every time at the same exact spot. I am using SM-T287 tablet android 5.1.1 kernel version 3.10.65-7470279. Dont know if this will be useful for the developers but I have to say, there should have been done enough tests with available tools before publishing.	1
6580	can not trust this app. My neighbours (2 people) has tested positive and it shows zero case in 1 km radius. They are at home isolation.	1
6581	Chews power & constant notification that can't be cleared. Remove the notification as it should just run in background.	1

6634	After successfully done the setup, the next time I checked on it, it show "setup is incomplete!". Already done setup a few times, still the same issue	1
6635	observed strange behaviour from this app in the last few hours. devoured battery life and caused the device to heat up noticeably. i've never seen something like that before - uninstalled the app, believing it had been hacked. strange behaviour that warrants investigation. (edit): the phone reports unusually high battery usage by my online banking app during the same period. this looks very dodgy.	1
6636	I tested week ago but this app still showing old one. Is it possible to check from another way?	1
6637	Sir Why this app is not opening after update it's says that app doesnt responding? Please resolved this issue as soon as possible Regards.	1

6641	Interfered w my BT connectivity to my sound sys -- in fact caused the connectivity to be totally lost. Couldn't reconnect whatsoever. Pissed!	1
6642	I'm starting to regret installing this app in the first place; ever since I set up my account, the music I'm listening to via either my Bluetooth earbuds or my BT speaker becomes laggy or gets cut off several times (even if I'm just listening to one song on continuous loop). To top it off, it's literally killing my Samsung Galaxy A8 Star's battery life to the point where I have to recharge it 3 times a day as opposed to only every night previously.	1

6718	Good	0
6719	Gr8 idea! My 2 cents (each rated for 1 extra star) : 1. You really should add usage statistics like how many users (EXACTLY) have downloaded and of how many have activated the app (REALTIME) 2. How many users have reported ill - there is very little point for this app, if half of the downloaders don't activate it. And there is NO point, if only 10 individuals have reported ill, even if a million people installed. This simple info should be available for all activated users (MOTIVATIONAL!).	1

I thought it would be a good idea to get this... However my first overview of the scans it has done seems that it's a bit pointless. It scans very last at night/early hours of the morning of course I haven't been in contact with someone at that time I'm in bed I wanted it to protect me from customers in my daily work!	1

6779	Interfering with my Google Home device. Cannot use other apps on mobile without them connecting to it since installing this one, without turning off Bluetooth, then this app does not work.	1

6795	Good	0
6796	Seriously draining my battery in the last 24 hours. Went to bed friday night with 60% battery and had 6% when I woke up. I have the new S20, and my battery usually lasts 24 to 36 hours from full charge. If it happens again today will be uninstalling.	1
6797	Very nice app.	0
6798	Works well.	0
6799	The application is mandatory for all resindents in the country. However, It's not supported in old version of android. There are people who are unable to buy a new phone due to financial circumstances. Those needs special attention as they are struggling to reach grocesseries to buy thier daily stuffs.	1
6800	Works well, not intrusive, updates automatically. Does what it's supposed to do. Plus, a nice place to see simple relevant statistics on Covid in Belgium	0

6804	Just we cooperate with govt efforts. Once day when every one installs this ap it will become useful. Hope so.	0
6805	No Audible notifications, you must keep an eye on your phone to check in when required No support.. You must grant the app access to your storage and files otherwise will not work... Unfair.	1
6806	I'd like to sign up but it won't accept my mobile phone no	1
6807	After updating its new updates, now this is not working	1
6808	The app interferes with my car's bluetooth setting and I couldn't connect to Android Auto as a result :(	1
6809	Easy & not invasive	0
6810	I gave 1 star because I cant register i try it many times bluetooth and location is turn but still nothing, i dont know whats the problem but always come "error requesting otp... Please help us with how it happen..Thank you	1
6811	Valoi	0
6812	I think the app works, would like to know how many keys have been exchanged. There is no clear indication to know if the app really works or not (keys exchanged) Except for the updates of the number of cases. Something's like collected.5 keys on day xyz. Should more or less correspond to the number of People i meet.	0
6813	Nice . But old version not working and download	0
6814	Had to uninstall as I couldn't keep my phone charged with it	1
6815	This is good app in corona timm	0

6829	What many says is true. It drained out the battery like a vampire. It is suprise to see that it won't show in the battery usage. Battery usage in Android will not show this app consumed so much battery. Not sure how the developer bypass/manage to do this. What is even more surprise me is that developer did not address/bother to reply on this issue. Hahaa...	1
6830	Fake app, my neighbor is corona positive and this app is unable to detect it.	1
6831	Interesting	0
6832	Recommendation: Add current user's location button.	0
6833	Nice app	0
6834	The app causes my music to pause playback every 30-60 seconds when streaming to a speaker or headphones from the phone using bluetooth. It's like the covid safe app needs to borrow the bluetooth connection every time it tries the "electronic handshake". No option to pause the app to overcome the problem so had to completely uninstall. If there was a "pause for 1 hr feature" I would have kept the app. Will reinstall if this is fixed.	1
6835	Good application	0
6836	Some times apps shows "bluetooth not working" but i already ON bluetooth. One more info is it any way to show reminder notifications,30 minutes after check in because some times forget to checkout. If have notification alert easy to checkout forget peoples.thanks	1
6837	very Good	0
6838	Consumes battery as fast as it needs to charge twice a day.	1
6839	Not worth it if they (DHHS) do not even bother using it.	1
6840	Cant install. Doesnt recognise my mobile number. Absolute joke.	1
6841	Would be good to have a 2h or 4h reminder if we are still in the premises as we may forget to check out! If we are still in the premises, we can just disregard and swipe the notification away so it is not too troublesome for us	0
6842	Hard to keep the battery charged for long enough for the phone or app to be useful	1
6843	Overall I'm impressed with the app. Simple to use and good design as well! However, it does drain my battery a little, but I'm fine with it, after all the app is protecting me from Covid. Perhaps u could add in dark mode for the app as well, just a suggestion. Otherwise all is good with the app!! \u263a\ufe0f	0
6844	Useless application	1
6845	New version is nice with all relevant info. Can get the numbers, testing locations and link to curfew certificate.	0
6846	super	0
6847	I was checking I everyday however my phone has been overheating the last 2 days and having gone through the phone it can be traced back to the app so I've had to delete it. I plugged out my phone and did not use at all for approximately 10 minutes and it drained my battery by more than 10% and overheated again.	1
6848	After installing, when I use my wireless earbuds it will cause the earbud to dc and auto reconnect back. This will happen 2-3 times in a frame of 30-45mins of use. Happen to my samsung note 9 and now oppo find x2 pro	1

6861	Why can't i receive the OTP? I have tried for two days..!!	1
6862	I like but Sam divided no warking	0
6863	Best example of how to waste public money. How many contact traces done with this? App needed location access all time. But main purpose is to identify anybody come closer to 1.5m distance.. No logic at all. Battery drains rapidly, So need to charge phone one more time during the day. So many updates since first release, but no evidence of this app is working. Only good thing is keeping few people in job who built this app and staff working for the companies who ran 60+million campaign.	1
6864	Very good app needed for the deconfinement, every good citizen must download this app'. Must be improved with a tdlr.	0
6865	App crash whenever SafeEntry check-in is tapped on is fixed for me. The new design is nice. However, would appreciate if the app were to adopt the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API (this setting is now shown as being “not available in your region” in settings).	1
6866	Can I register this app on 3 device with same contact number ??	1
6867	Everytime i installed trace together app, my phone becomes very slow and laggy. Even after turning off bluetooth at home, my phone is still very laggy	1
6868	This App has Privacy Issue. I think GoI is Stealing Users Data.	1
6869	Invalid phone number. Uhh, actually, my number is 100% valid. Don't blame ME for a problem with the app or the system. Typical government attitude.	1

6884	Still error. the program closes itself	1
6885	App crashes and hangs after update	1

6962	Since I have installed the app the region settings of my phone are often changed to United States by itself.\nThis is very annoying. I have to reinstall my keyboards, the way the date and hour is displayed is changing, etc.\nTherefore I give this app 2 stars. When this bug is fixed I will give it a 5 star-rating.\nEvery small thing we can do to beat this virus is importing. Also using this app.	1

7007	I will promote this by maximum	0
7008	Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).	0
7009	Really it is not useful, we saw a lot of options on news but nothing is working on the application itself. I spent one hour to login to see later service is not available.	1
7010	Good	0
7011	Phone slow and not really a lot of information	1
7012	To promote confidence in this app, it should be able to report its activity, in terms of how many connections it has registered recently and over time, and (with permission) how many it is currently registering, in real time. That would also promote some interest and curiosity among users.	1
7013	Everytime I try to sign into the app it says that it is "Temporarily unavailable" and that "We're really sorry. Please try again later." I have tried many times and yet the same thing shows up.	1
7014	The app is good from the use I had of it. Unfortunately I had to delete the app as it was completely draining my battery (OnePlus 7Tpro) within a few hours of full charge. It would normally last more than a day per charge. My wife experienced the same issue (OnePlus 6T).	1

7026	No problems installing but it absolutely chews through battery. New S10+ used to last a full day. I head to charge it at midday just to use the rest off the day. Once again down to 40% after only 3 hours.	1
7027	Very good application	0
7028	Can't go back! And i think it's good idea to add English language. Otherwise it's good. Thanks.	1
7029	Useless app if you're the only one using it since it only works by able to detect users with the app and bluetooth on. Good initiative but too little people are downloading it. Drains battery super fast, push notification fine as it does show its working. Decent app but rendered useless due to lack of users.	1
7030	Can the app start by itself when ever I turn on the phone? Can the notification run in the background	1
7031	Batt drains fast and it doesnt make sense why it requires access to storage. Even my bank app doesnt ask for that kind of information.	1

7041	I'm in France so installed: I thought it was active, but wasn't.  To run in  background go to 'Settings' gear symbol then: Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special App access > Battery optimization. This critical or it's not running. Annoying is the msg to say it's running and inability to clear it's messages. So long as I see flash to say it's running in background I don't care to have irrelevant msgs always present. 4 stars because to stop covid19 is important	1
7042	No use of downloading this app. I have done 3 swab tests until now but this app not showing any results. From the beginning it's showing results not available but I got my results already through other source.	1

7053	Whoever made this app has no common sense whatsoever. Firstly, as a national serviceman I do not have my NRIC and thus no way to see what my NRIC date of issue is. I had to go beg an incompetent S1 branch for it. Secondly, it takes such a long time to open the app. Huge inconvenience to users. Thirdly, the above mentioned points only apply if one is even able to set up the app(watching grass grow is faster and frankly less infuriating). Thanks for nothing.	1
7054	Good concept but Poor execution. I am unable to Register using my phone, when others with the Same model and Version of the Software can. Reinstalled several times, Cleared all Caches and Settings, Bluetooth On and Off....tried everything but you have NO Help options either Here or on your Website. Given the Necessity of the App and the expected/required usage for Public Health reasons, it needs better Support.	0
7055	Pain in the arse. Runs my battery flat at night so I turn it off. Forget to turn it on when I go out, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place. Also hard on the battery using location while running when I'm out and battery goes flat, also defeating the point of having it. I have a high end phone ..

7057	Thank	0
7058	I'm sad. I saw that my friend using iPhone has a widget, but we don't have it on android phones. Also, the splash screen which displays for a few seconds each time we open the app makes starting the app and use the features longer than it could be. No wonder, there's always people stuck at the barcode waiting for the app to load.	1

7061	Great	0
7062	Why is that it shows error while requesting for OTP.. im unable to use this app	1
7063	Useless	1
7064	No problems installing but it absolutely chews through battery. New S10+ used to last a full day. I head to charge it at midday just to use the rest off the day. Once again down to 40% after only 3 hours.	1
7065	I can't believe this......the whole day I was stayed in my room but the app showing 100 over exchanges.....how close a person then consider exchange?	1
7066	Shouldn't use bluetooth. It's unsafe to have your Bluetooth switched on all the time	0

7079	Having the same problem described below. I own an OPPO phone and constantly get messages about disabling battery optimisation. I do so and within a few hours get another message. I'm sick of maintaining it. Fix it or I'll remove it and take my chances. I haven't yet seen any stats as to the success of the app in doing the job it's designed for. Unlikely if others are having the same issues.	1
7080	Unable to input date of birth. The app keeps behaving odd.	1
7081	The app is draining my battery at a rate that is unexpected. I usually make it through the day using around 67% by the time I recharge at 10 pm. I have had to plug the phone in at around 1pm as it's totally flat......... perhaps you can work on this.	1

7108	Whats the point of this app if we are not suppose to go outside?	1
7109	ok so this app doesnt work if you use tpg as your mobile network bc tpg is not very good and like even though im using it ( bc free ) and tpg lies to their users so change your network and download this again but yes i cldnt get the otp bc of the " invalid " number thing	1

7118	It works as intended. Without collecting and storing unnecessary data	0
7119	Great Idea, But Major Flaws MUST be attended immediately. Service should be accessible to ALL people in our country, currently this app cannot be activated with VISITORS details. It is a major drawback. and Compatibility issues, with Black Berry, IOS under 13, android under 6 etc. Developers should work on it, or else it will be useless.

7126	This will only work if people feel they have a stake in it and that they are getting something useful out if it too. People need to feel involved in the design of new features. Consider co creation approach where you ask users what features they would like or dislike then deliver. E2E UX design will paramount to adoption. Some suggestions : more granular detail of local cases. Personalised on ur homescreen based on your location, county level maybe Notification to remind user to checking each	0
7127	That is a amizing app for tracing corona..	0
7128	So far so good. 4 stars because I would prefer the option of being able to turn off the bluetooth and location permissions whenever I'm not out in public. I have turned Bluetooth off but there is a constant notification telling me it's turned off and I can't clear the notification off the screen. Considering that most of the time I am at home I don't think I need to have the app activated at all times.	0

7131	Very helpful and useful app. I like it \u270b.	0
7132	This occupies my bluetooth and creates connection issues and intermittent dropping out when using my headphones or any bluetooth connected device when making calls, playing music, casting A/V. No good. This is on a galaxy s10+. Also, you can delete the permanent 'protecting' notification on status bar easily. If the bluetooth issue can be fixed, I may re-install it.	1
7133	I have installed tha app and tried to sign up. But it is asking for QID number and I don't have that since am in Business Visa. Can anyone help on this ? They are saying it's mandatory if i go outside	1
7134	Any previous issues with battery drain have been fixed now completely, no problems with it	1
7135	Why i can't use this app	1
7136	Easy registration process. Leave off the 0 that is the first digit of your mobile number. Sad that it doesn't work on android 5 though. Only one of our family can register.	0

7141	Excellent app for covid 19	0
7142	For an app that's meant to help protect the community its poorly designed and filled with glitches. After installing it on my s20 I couldn't open any apps without them crashing and my battery drains way too quickly. I ended up uninstalling the app. You would think they would put better design into an app like this. Why do we also need Bluetooth on? Seems silly	1
7143	Good	0

7145	Nice and very much useful	0
7146	Behind this app 100%. I have had no issues at all and it hasn't drained my battery or anything. Everyone needs to come on board so we can be back to normal as soon as possible!!	1

7148	Exilent	0
7149	Bad service	1
7150	Useless app	1
7151	Works great if people who were exposed to covid 19 also have the app, if they don't have it or don't own a smartphone or leave their phone in the car or at home etc then it's obviously useless, they could be sitting beside you and you wouldn't know it. Best to just do the 2m thing and wear our masks	0
7152	Helping my husband (army regular) to download and register the app. App requested for NRIC date of issue for completion of registration. Army guys do not have NRIC with them so it's puzzling why this piece of information is critical for registration. Thumbs down. Update: Yes, of course I read that part. Why make it extra harder for NS servicemen to download and start using this app? If this piece of information is not critical, why request for such information??	1

7180	Great app, using it everywhere. BUT why does it log me out? I saw there’s an update but decide not to do that till I’ve got a minute to find my note with the password as I know I’ll need to after updating. But it logged me out even though I didn’t run the update yet. I know I shouldn’t have passwords written down but I simply can’t remember them all and haven’t had time to investigate password apps! Can you stop the app from logging people out - I know it’s happened to others at times too?	1
7181	Had to uninstall because it was messing with my Bluetooth and WIFI connections. Constant cutouts of my earbuds and even cutouts of my Google WiFi home network	1

7216	Needs location permission to access Bluetooth low energy, but doesn't do location requests, so battery consumption is low. It happily coexists with the Italian immuni app. This is important if you regularly cross FR-IT border. In principle this app should be valid for MC. When you first install it may take a few retries to activate the service. Don't worry, retry some hours later. It doesn't ask for any data.	1

7231	This is one of the worst apps ever by UAE. The results don't get automatically updated. You have to call specifically to inform that please update my results. This is just a useless application being promoted. Not at all useful THE GREAT ALHOSN APP. Will uninstall it.	1
7232	3030.6.28 The app is completely useless. So far none of a confirmed case was identified by this app and none of the people in close contact with confirmed cases were informed!  This app behaves like Youtube in that it only works when it\u2019s running in foreground. Who is going to use an iPhone as a dedicated COVID-19 app device?  Technically it\u2019s a bad app. When the COVIDSAFE app is loaded, the bluetooth becomes a mess. As seen from Settings, the Bluetooth turns on and off and on and off by itself; native bluetooth devices like Apple watch and third party headphones disconnect; medical devices like Accu Chek BGL test device and Sphygmomanometer (blood pressure test device) need to be forgotten, all mentioned above have to be reset and restarted and repair again. Terrible.	1

7254	Looking good. Only thing is that the "share app usage statistics" is defaulted on. Need to go into settings if you wish to turn these off	0
7255	I support the project. But in my case it consumes a lot of battery and my phone do not reach the evening any more. That is also the moment of the day where I potentially meet more peoples. So it makes the application unuseful to me. Maybe an idea would be to have the possibility to define some criteria where the application stop itself. For example by checking for available wireless? I think the application don't need to run at home or at work (if it is not related with public). That would maybe save a lot of battery.	1

7260	Clean, clear, simple app	0
7261	The apps ask for too much non essential details, which could be stolen when hacked. This had discouraged many people from signing up. 1. Full NRIC is not needed per PDPA, as the last 4 figures would already enable traceability. 2. Date of issue of NRIC is NOT needed. 3. Birthdate is also NOT needed. The above are NOT necessary for the purpose of contact tracing and should be taken out. Good to have, but not needed. Please reconsider the needs to have these data, in future updates.	1

7264	Great idea being that I am on chemo but would be better if I didn't drain my battery kinda need it for calls and texts.

7282	I keep COVID Alert running in the background (not sure if I have to) and there’s no battery drain I can see from it. I love that it’s private and uses random changing number strings to ping other phones. It’s a simple app that says yes or no you’ve been exposed. Everyone who can should download it! The more who do, the better we’ll get control of COVID-19. We’re all in this together!	0

7307	Have searched for counties in North of Ireland and there are no northern counties listed. Description states Ireland... Make it so. Bitterly disappointed. Also it would be more useful to use wireless and not Bluetooth as Bluetooth uses an awful lot of battery power...Uninstalled.	1
7308	This is useless app. It doesn't serve any purpose for intelligent persons. It doesn't any sort of sensor. Even if we take the mobile phone and put in the mouth of a Covid'19 patient it doesn't recognize Corona disease. It's only useful for stistical purposes.	1
7309	The app needs to be fixed it drains the battery	1
7310	Bekar	1
7311	System fails if not enough people use it (false feeling of being safe). Only updates once every 24 hrs. Requires bluetooth AND location to be on 24/7.	1
7312	radius function not working	1
7313	Please please use the Google Covid APIs and allow the interconnexion between EU countries... That's a joke	1
7314	Asks for GPS location. I uninstalled this app because it kept asking me to enable Google location services, therefore accessing my GPS location. This is in stark contrast to what was claimed.	1

7322	Only allow users to pause the scanning up to 8 hours... working from home for months and only head out once every week. Have to pause the app on a 8 hour basis to avoid battery drain.	1

7337	So far it's a great concept to track your status. Edit: I would like to suggest that you give us the option for a sleep mode. A time frame where you let our batteries rest. Like when we're asleep.	0

7368	\u2018Error verifying phone number\u2019 when entering all but the leading zero of my mobile number	1
7369	This app only checks exposure if it comes within a short distance of someone else who has the app. No exposure checks mean you havent been close enough to someone for it to check.	1
7370	Thanks guys, test results issue fixed \ud83d\udc4d	0
7371	Checking daily. Great	0
7372	This app is very important for me I thanks govt of this message	0
7373	This App causes interruption in Bluetooth Devices.	1
7374	Dissaster phone killing app, access to delete and format SD card? Access to private library??? Power hungry, constant pinging location draning battery and the phone goes hot it is obligated to be installed. COVID 19 or not, Thank you very much for that. Needs heavy optimization and less agressive personal data access .	1
7375	Doesn't work properly. Checked it to see if it was still active on December 10th, and while it said "Active", it clearly was not because it reacted by downloading data and immediately giving me a warning that I had been in contact with an infected. I had not been outside at all that day, so I am left to conclude that this warning is potentially months old. So the app is apparently absolutely useless unless you check it daily.	1

7384	excellent app	0
7385	Terrible application	1
7386	Drains to much battery with Bluetooth on all the time. In spite my data privacy concerns, I think it is a good move to improve contact tracing but the app could provide a list of the places, with date and time, where I checked in for my own control. It is already collecting my info so why not allow me to access it?	1
7387	Fix the reliance on Play services. Huawei phones can access the play store but can't use the app if it requires play services.	1
7388	Thank you ScoMo	0
7389	I thought only bluetooth is used.. so why is Location also activated? Location is tracking and invading of privacy. News reports say only bluetooth is needed. Why was activation of location not highlighted to us? What is going on? Bad reply to my questions..if you know it's going to be activated, why is it not informed to all? Why hide?	1
7390	Pathetic.	1
7391	Was working fine until two days ago. Completely draining my battery and making my phone run hot over the weekend. Read about this issue in an article this morning and decided to uninstall to see if it made any difference and my battery is 100% better off with that decision.	1

7415	Why does it crashed when I deny to accept in accessing my photos and calls??? It doesnt do anything with COVID or anything..its personal and private thing. I have my kids pictures and a lot of thing which I dont like to share. And why phone calls??? Why do you even ask if its not a choice anyway?	1
7416	The app works fine for 2-3 weeks, and then it starts crashing when I try to activate it. It's the 3rd times it happens, the only workaround I found is to delete the app and then reinstall. But then it is loosing all of my contact history, so the whole tracing becomes useless, because I now have to choose between loosing my contact tracing history of the last few weeks but have a renewed tracking for the upcoming weeks, or keeping the history and not be able to have tracing for the future.	1
7417	why keep stopping sometimes and need feedback ? i can't open if i need to check \ud83e\udd14	1
7418	Malwarebytes Scanned this app as Trojan Spy Please scan by Yourself and check i am sure it will show since we cannot post screenshots in reviews otherwise i would have done it also. Please Take a look at the issue and confirm. I am expecting a reply on the same from developers	1

7436	Not working on HMS phones. If you wish to implement the usage of this app. At least make it available on all smartphones l.	1
7437	Unusable. The recent update requiring location services be turned on makes the battery usage unacceptable and defies the entire point of the app in the first place. Needs major work or no one will use it.	1

7595	I don't understand how such an app is made mandatory. It should be tested before being a recommendation. It drains my battery so much. I've even tested it on both android and iphone and both battery utilization is bad. The app causes lots of frustration. I rather scan my IC then use this app.	1
7596	bad app, always not responding!	1
7597	No update in several days on stats. Info too slow to be updated so have uninstalled.	1
7598	The app keeps closing itself so yeah. Not great.	1
7599	I was using this app from when it was first available. After a few days I noticed my Samsung Note 9 (with all the latest software/firmware etc...) not being able to download apps from app store or updating existing apps. Apps would get to 99% and just freeze and not install. I reset my phone to factory default twice only to discover the fault would return once the phone was restored with the same apps. I noticed on the second data reset I activated the COVID app first then, whilst setting the phone back up to it's usual operation, I wasn't able to connect to my Smart watch via bluetooth or my bluetooth headset. When I deactivated the COVID app I was able to connect to these devices. When I deleted the COVID app I was able to download and update apps from Play Store. I like the concept of the app but not if it blocks my notifications and causes my phone not to operate correctly. My wife has it installed on Note 10 and all seems fine.	1

7601	Very easy to install . I feel it's a good idea ,so will feel safer when I'm out shopping ect.l	0
7602	Activation doesn't work if the ID is expired. For residents still waiting for renewal what should they do since the deadline is friday 22nd I presume all the offices still closed some are not even sure how the renewal of the ID is done at the moment.	1

7613	After getting frustrated being told phone number is invalid......I turned off WIFI and hey presto....everything worked:)	1
7614	After this app download, it will create lot of issue with my phone and my Bluetooth earpieces also not working well. . . .	1
7615	May have damaged my phone. I have the new Samsung A31. I set up the phone with all my old apps, including the Covid app; I then had issues with the camera and the phone freezing. After factory resetting it, it worked fine. I installed each app one at a time and the issues reappeared after the Covid app was installed. I have a replacement phone now and, while I believe in the importance of the app, I'm afraid to install it should it damage my new phone...	1
7616	This app is not perfected, while talking on the phone the Bluetooth cut me off from talking three times I had to turn the Bluetooth off to continue uninterrupted. Disappointed with this app. Please find a fix.	1
7617	Dear developer did not recognize my OTP number please fix this issue thanks..	1

7622	A great app! Well built and completely anonymous. I hope enough people will install it. Kudos to Belgium for this!	0
7623	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
7624	Ghost covid-19 tracker is amazing I can see everyday if I don't have covid-19 or if I have	1
7625	I deleted my trace together app on my old phone and downloaded it on my new phone and it keeps not letting my account be created and after that I already emailed to them and they told me to send my last 5 digits of nric and etc and I did that but still nothings changed I'm seriously annoyed at this point cuz I already reinstalled this app plenty of times on my new phone to make the account and the problem is never fixed \ud83d\ude12	1
7626	Clean and simple. Explains clearly what it does and how. Can't say (yet) if it works like it should... But that's not the fault of the app necessarily. One minor nitpick: It'd be nice if the language could be selected in the settings.	0
7627	Great app by all standards.	0

7656	v1.0.17 - Permanent notification blank when app in Active state. It only shows a time, which appears to be the last time it was set to Active. Using it on the train with the rapid circulation of air, a 1.5m radius requiring a 15min exposure is insufficient to detect all possible exposures. I would also like to see some basic statistics about how many valid connections I've had and when.	1
7657	Unable to register now, tried multiple times. Was working alright last week, just refuses to run now. Least that can be done is make the app work, so people are not inconvenienced. Since entry into supermarkets requires this app, how do I shop for groceries when the app refuses to work?	1
7658	This app was sold to us as a means to prevent us from being locked up like cattle. So I'm deleting it until the government comes to their senses. Also it uses too much battery and apparently hasn't found a single contact in the latest outbreak.	1
7659	Good	0

7680	Notification bar for other apps cut off after latest update. Was ready to do a complete reset on my phone because of this. I have already reset all my apps and have been spending the last 3 days re configuring all the preferences so I'm pissed off. Couldn't find anything on Google to explain why this was happening then had a revelation that it might be this app causing all my headaches and lo and behold I deleted the app and I have my phone back! Now I just have to get all my apps back in order	1
7681	Good work	0
7682	I could not open the scanning as it asked me to update google play services but i had already updated. I am using Xiaomi mi max 3 currently thank you.	1
7683	This application gives you current coronavirus statistics and the HES code which is mandatory for domestic travel in Turkey. I downloaded it for the latter reason. However, it is not clear how the code works. The application should clarify this. You just get the HES code, and use it for travel.	0
7684	In the latest update, after we update key personal data such as NRIC number and NRIC expiry date etc, our data will be saved. These data can be obtained simply by opening the app. No login is required. Even the Singpass app which is also able to produce our NRIC barcode requires an authentication login to access the data. Please rectify this immediately. I can't even "log out" delete the personal data.	1
7685	Works ok and has not had any noticeable affect on battery life. Download it, stay safe.	0
7686	This app does not give correct and quick information.	1
7687	Nice App	0
7688	There're huge vulnerable segments that this app doesn't reach. These are foreign workers and senior citizens. Most of these users are still on Android Kitkat. Probably 9/10 users in this demographic segment are on Kitkat. This OS is still popular in cheap phones sold to this demographic segment. Phones on Kitkat are still available for retail. I hope you can kindly build support for Kitkat.	1

7719	Useless app. Only download it if mandatory at some instance. Deny all permissions. It's just a self incriminating application	1
7720	My battery has been draining constantly. Yesterday, the 9th, I deleted the app. Reinstalled it last night. Went to bed, with 90% battery to wake to it being down to 15%. Despite liking the app and the concept behind it, I've since deleted the app and hope there are no long term affects on my battery. My phone is less than 2 months old, Huwaei P30 Pro.	1
7721	Fabulous way to track Covid- especially if the spread continues.\n\nUser friendly. \n\n1 star reviewers might need to revisit their Facebook/Snapchat/tok tok accounts if they are worried about privacy and password encryption.	0

7738	Totally STUPID App... It doesn't specify zone wise number of corona patients and hiw soneone will know if there's anyone infected nearby him. Data provided in this app can be accessible by normal web browsing.. on the other hand, this app is obly usable by those mobile users who have only Bluetooth and GPS access at their mobile... What a joke.... I'm utterly surprised and immediately uninstalled the app...	1
7739	Well apps	0
7740	This is great initiative. I would suggest to publish info about number of installations, to show how much people use the app. This should build more trust. In Google store it just 500k for now, not that much compare to country population.	1

7844	Helpful	0
7845	Technical recommendations: Many users, does not read the activation steps, that must be shown as steps by step navigation wizard. Many users does not know that 'enabling bluetooth' is essential for registering first time. Those who get popup messages such as 'ID card expired' or 'error registering' must first enable the bluetooth and try again. Instead of above message, the developer can add the specific reason, so that it will be more user friendly.	1

7847	I liked the updated updates page this morning, with the number of tests and the positivity rate, and more sobering detail on the number of new cases over time.

7869	For some reason, the battery of my phone is shooting through the roof too. And it happened since sometime last week. It was still tolerable before that although it started to really suck the battery like no tomorrow. And today's the worst. My phone suddenly went flat of battery when I woke up. Usually my phone will still have about 80% battery in the mornings. Last few days it had gone down to below 50% and today is the worst. It went totally flat and I had to wait for the phone to charge from 0	1
7870	Hi there, I m using xiaomi Redmi K20 Prond after the latest MIUI update, my TraceTogether stop working in the sense that it is unable to dony Bluetooth exchange. Had verified using the same TraceTogether account with another phone and it still works well. Please kindly see if it is this new MIUI was not accounted for, thanks!	1
7871	Would love to support it. I was able to register however I've noticed that with my Bluetooth headset - I have a NOTICEABLE delay of 5-10 of no audio when I answer a call. It's frustrating and annoying. Right now I'm isolated anyway so I'm not fussed but there will be others that connect their headset and in some cases other Bluetooth devices (namely keyboard and mouse) to their phone. I can do without the keyboard and mouse but it's very frustrating to have this consistent lack of audio.	0

7882	Hi, in the last 30 hours my Samsung A5 keeps reporting that Covid App is hogging CPU and phone needs to be restarted. Indeed a full battery charge is drained in a few hours and phone is very hot to touch. I checked online, did a few things like cleaning Google play service cache etc. Even Unistalled Play service updates but still the same. In the end I had to uninstall Covid App which is NOT something I want to do. You guys wrote this App. You need to investigate and revert clear message.	1
7883	Downloaded it a few days ago but till now still cant register. Firstly i did not get SMS verification. Then next day, my ic number entered is stated as invalid despite several attemps. I gave up trying to register and have uninstalled it.	1
7884	Downloaded fine, entered my details but when it came to entering my mob number the app keeps telling me my mob number is invalid.	1
7885	It was hard to open an account because the landing page after requesting OTP didn't appear, which may be due to internet connection. However when testing this with someone who has cough and was therefore categorized as "Mild Condition," nothing came up on my scan even when turning on both Bluetooth and location. There was no clear explanation on the purpose of the QR code or scanner and health information was only available in the English language. 3D world view is unnecessary and uses up memory	1
7886	Great app and shows that the government is truly fully smart and capable of cloud governing. I am proud to be a Saudi, seriously! Special thanks to SDAIA, great job!	0
7887	Beware of app draining battery constantly getting notifications to turn my Bluetooth on is so annoying please make the app less intrusive and also who would want a app that sends your battery life from 100% down to 5% in less than 2 hours and that's caused by COVIDsafe notifications and Bluetooth being on 24/7 so bloody annoying	1
7888	Update 10.08.20: Deleted cache and all data from Google Play Services and battery use seems to have stabilised. Like the app but have would recommend some tweaks: - Daily confirmed cases graph covers too broad a timeline. Would be better to have a week by week option to show trends. - Cases/deaths stats should show daily or weekly movement comparisons. -Total cases per county is fairly meaningless, ignores population density for one.	1
7889	Easy to set up and doesn't have any noticeable impact on my battery life	0

7899	My review disappeared, so here's another. This app does not appear to work on bbk phones (Oppo going by reviews here, and Realme going by my own experience with my Realme X2 Pro). It tells you it's not active and battery optimisation needs to be switched off. And you do that, use another app and it's inactive again. Still not fixed, and it's mid November.	1

7917	This app cripples push notifications of other apps such as WhatsApp. After turning on TraceTogether, other apps does not receive push notifications until you open them. In addition, with TraceTogether running, my phone is unable to download or update any apps from playstore. The download/update will be stucked at 100% without installing them. Only way to make it work again is to force stop TraceTogether, restart phone then updates other apps.	1

7925	Covid tracing apps should be very low on battery use. I have used and tested multipe national apps, and the French tous anti covid is the single app that drains the battery, making it very undesirable for average public to use. Seconds critique is that it needs manual activation. Most other apps automatically activate once Bluetooth is on. Why force the user to open the app and activate? I like the statistics page and useful links.	1

I used to charge once a day, but now I have to charge 3 times a day. I guess it is the price to pay to help out with tracking the virus...

8007	This app is the best thing i have ever seen. It supports most devices. it doesn't install on my device. that's why i love it so much, it's so trash i love it. You thing it would be compatible with all devices, but that's why your wrong.I have a Samsung yet the app isn't compatible with my phone. As the Department of Health states that "The COVIDSafe app is part of our work to slow the spread of COVID-19. Having confidence we can find and contain outbreaks quickly will mean governments can ease restrictions while still keeping Australians safe." How can i slow this without the app? Do i go to everyone i see and that comes in range of me and say hay whats your name and phone number because that is not weird. so i can contact them all? Another thing the Government said was "The new COVIDSafe app is completely voluntary. Downloading the app is something you can do to protect you, your family and friends and save the lives of other Australians. The more Australians connect to the COVIDSafe app, the quicker we can find the virus." Yet i fail to see how by not having the app helps. congrats to the Australian government for a incompatible app on many peoples smart devices. :)	0

After downloading it 's not giving the OTP password . I called the supporting team call center# 109 to help but the agents are always busy . They said " u can expect call within 2 hours " now it's been 6 hours and no one called . This application needs technical improvement to work in all type of mobiles and to give the OtP immediately.

8025	The app is clearly not working on my phone. If I go into google settings and check to see how many times any app has used the built in covid tracing section of the operating system it states that in the last 14 days the stopcovidni app has accessed my bluetooth keys once. That just happens to be the once that I opened the stopcovidni app two minutes before checking google settings. Obviously each time I close the app it does not continue to run in the background as suggested.	1

8036	As per title. It’s not a very smart decision to make to force us to turn on Bluetooth & leaving it on as it drains a lot of my battery especially if I have to leave the app running in the background. Even if we bring a power bank along with us, it will also get drained out. How many power banks do you expect us to bring along? 100?\n\nAs a developer, you can’t just think from your own point of view. You’ll also need to factor in things like user experience, usability, practicality & your app isn’t the only app we are using. I use my phone for work & I can’t afford for my phone to die on me just because your app drains my phone of battery. And these days, we’re trying to travel light, am I supposed to bring along 100 power banks along with me to ensure my phone battery doesn’t die on me when I’m outside? Please take into consideration that we may not be near a power source for us to plug in our phones 24/7 or be rich enough to buy 100 power banks or have enough space in our bags to carry all these power banks or even find it light enough to do so.\n\nLast but not least, if you guys want to force us into using something you guys created, at least please make it a pleasant experience & not make us hate or detest it even more. Wouldn’t it be better to make this app so fantastic & lovable that everyone WANTS to use it & not because we’re being forced to go through a torturous experience?\n\nThank you for reading through this valuable feedback & looking into the matter.	1

8040	I'm editing my previous review as I think I might have been quite unfair with the view that it consumed a lot of my battery. I use it only when I am out and I force-stop it when I'm home.

8047	Using the app since the launch and I'm happy. It achieves what it promises: efficient and transparent covid-19 contact tracing in this new normal. I found the app to have a clean and neat design and it runs smoothly in the background. No noticeable battery loss on my 2+ year old Sony xperia series phone. (Tip: If you are too worried about the battery, which given the situation is a minor inconvenience at most, maybe consider switching off the bluetooth and location when you are inside your home for long durations).	0

8054	Bluetooth/BTLE technology was not designed as used by the app designers. No coordination with OS vendor Google. Very inefficient design and low compatibility to wide range of Android OS devices . Security and safety has yet to be proven for the app as it has not been peer reviewed by non-Singapore based Security researchers for infosec purposes .	1
8055	The UX is very nice and I like to easy to read, smooth black theme. However the introduction text could be a bit condensed, and I wished more people used it so it's really useful... But that's not the devs choice. Anyhow I hope this app helps me know if I was at risk for covid, and that it'll keep us safe and aware.	0
8056	Destroys battery life. Ever since Kildare, Offaly and Laois went back into lockdown, the app constantly runs in the background. It caused my brand new Samsung S20 to go from 100% to 0% in 4 hours. I would usually only charge the phone once every 2 days.	1

8058	I have installed the latest version 1.8.2. I seriously doubt this "android" version is working properly... one of my family members tested positive, and the results were being uploaded to the website. The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0

8081	Works well and no real issues running on Mate 9. This is a 3 year old phone, so seems OK on phones that are if this vintage or younger, providing the operating system is kept reasonably up to date. I can't vouch for anything older. I heard that it only works on Android 6 and above. That would mean that phones with operating systems of about 5 years old or older can't run this app. Power consumption is fairly light. Not releasing source code is a minor concern.	0

8097	Seems okay. To turn off the constant notification: Settings, Apps, CovidSafe, Notifications. Tap the A to gain control. Set it to the second level. (You can force stop it from here, too, if you want it off to save battery when at home.) To enter your phone number, leave out the initial 0. I don't understand why it wants location permissions, but it seems to be happy with location services turned off.

8108	Installed and worked perfectly fine, sign up was a breeze and had no issues. I've read many reviews and there are a lot of concerns with mobile numbers not being valid so I hope that can get sorted for the few who get that issue, other than that the security depends on your privacy settings in your phone as the app itself is more secure than most commercial apps.	0

8117	This apps drain off battery. After installed this apps, my phone occasionally will hang or no response. Observed this apps turns off by itself, i tried restart the apps but it keep flashing Tracetogether keeps stopping. Had to reinstall this apps to get it working again. This app also block adding new bluetooth device. I had to unistall this app so that i can add new device. Unfortunately i was forced to install it due to company requirement. This is really a badly designed apps.	1
8118	Since I started running this app my Bluetooth keeps getting turned off.	1
8119	I thought only bluetooth is used.. so why is Location also activated? Location is tracking and invading of privacy. News reports say only bluetooth is needed. Why was activation of location not highlighted to us? What is going on? Bad reply to my questions..if you know it's going to be activated, why is it not informed to all? Why hide?	1
8120	Drain phone battery. Not good	1
8121	Do not bother installing this app. Newspaper claimed 1m users installed it when numbers were 100k. It's anti-human and unconstitutional. Virus that has death rate lower than seasonal flu does not need an up. Who needs this app? Ask this question. Why there are no apps to stop drink driving in pubs? Get notified if person who was in a pub is now driving a car? Why no apps of pedophiles to protect your children from those who had convictions before? I am deleting this app to protect my pravicy.	1
8122	Latest update a problem. I use on Android. I do not have location on generally on my phone, but have given this app specifically location permission. Before the update, all fine. This update only allows the app to work if I turn on location for all my apps. I don't want to do that.	1

8168	Is it possible my app has been hacked? I force stopped it because the headphones symbol kept appearing as though someone was listening (no headphones plugged in). Same thing happened on my partner's phone (both android). We were also getting lots of ads for things that it was not possible for someone who was not with us to know about (no discussion in messages or emails, just in person etc). We traced it back to the covid safe app on both phones. Both of us have since stopped the app from working and noticed the headphone symbol has stopped appearing - need more time to confirm impact on advertisements.	1

8192	I've had no major problems. However the constant icon that appears with the install is annoying, I have a new Android so I was able to turn-off the foreground service notification for covidsafe in my app settings to get rid of it. I was unable to install the app to my elderly step dad's Samsung because despite only being a couple of years old it was incompatible. He reports that as a common issue amongst his peers. So I think there is room for improvement but no reason not to install it	1

8220	super easy setup process, after which it's pretty much "set it and forget it". No excessive permissions required. Doesn't seem to affect my battery life much.	0
8221	The app doesn't even work. It can't even set up because it say my IC is invalid. Like how can you guy fk up thing to set up the app itself	1
8222	Please add a QR Scan Widget if you are to make this app mandatory. Additionally, since it's not possible to physically be at 2 places at the same time, why doesn't a new "check in" (in a new place) automatically check you from the previous place?	1
8223	I've read 42+ reviews of people receiving an Invalid Phone Number error. One mentioned problems if registering before 6pm. One mentioned needing to "waiting a while". One mentioned it took several attempts. None of these apply to me, and I still get the error. My 9 digit phone number is definitely valid. You can only enter 9 digits anyway so don't enter a leading zero. Ensure not in flight mode. The app installed fine on my partners identical phone. I assume the computer boffins will be reading this & getting an update out as soon as possible! My partner is still waiting for the 6 digit PIN after 15 minutes. Server overload? Sounds like the last IBM census. 2 days later - still waiting for a fix...	1
8224	Good. Was worried it'd be a battery drain, but it doesn't do that	0
8225	It's a really helpful app. I did the test on 6th of April and app showing date on 1st of April. Can someone clarify?	1
8226	Seems pretty good. Does consume battery. I initially had issues because installing on a phone set with English as the language caused the activation to fail. It seems that issue was fixed quickly (a day or two) and now it works fine. Glad to have this now I'm going back out occasionally.	1

8302	Takes up A LOT of battery. I have to charge my phone several times a day now as compared to having my battery last for more than a day before installing this app. Tried the safe entry NRIC scanning feature once so far... didn't work.

Problems: 1 battery draining, 2 privacy violation. The Italian version does NOT require the phone #, neither the GPS. 1 GPS always on = battery drain; if it's not needed as claimed then don't ask for it! 2 If you adv that you don't take the data but then you ask my #, it's just a matter of "safety reasons" that my ID+gps will be released to police	1
8319	Over the past few weeks I have attempted over 10 times to install the app. On every occasion i get to the point where i enter my mobile number without the leading zero. After a while the app responds "try again later". No matter how many times I try I get the same response. As I never get past this point I don't get the pin to enter. I installed the app on my wife's phone in few minutes.	1

8363	Where to find the terms and conditions?? Constantly on GPS, drains battery, heating up the phone.	1
8364	Definitely helpful app. The ease of scanning is much easier compared to Singpass app. However, it will be great if we are able to check in for multiple persons in our family as well (as offered in Singpass). Additionally, the battery usage of the app is increasing. In a matter of 3 hours, my battery capacity is down more than 10%, without even using the phone. Upon checking, the trace together app is the one consuming all the power. I can provide the screenshots if you need. Thanks.	0
8365	I suspect this app doesn't do anything. After all the hoopla to get us to install, there was no data to prove it had done anything.	1

8409	Im a huawei p40 pro user. Once downloaded and i input my phone number. I didn't receive any otp code. Tried a few times and it's still the same	1
8410	Very straight forward app you download fill steps put your Id No. and phone no. You got otp and finish ,you can see the test result after pressing the Id number	0
8411	May I know why is the OTP not working? Apparently what waa sent wasnt the actual otp code.	1
8412	Nice	0
8413	App does not send notifications. You need to manually open it and proactively look up whether you had contact with anyone. Therefore completely useless, if you don't receive a notification.	1
8414	Doesn't bloody work	1
8415	The app is not usable on iPhone 6 and older :-(	1
8416	Any chance GovTech will make use of the new API introduced with iOS 13.5 to allow this app to work in background? This update has been out for awhile and it’s disappointing to see that this app is still not updated to make use of the new API. Really hope to see it soon.	1
8417	This app is so annoying. I like the idea but geez the fact that your Bluetooth is open 24/7 really? there's no way you can turn it off.	1
8418	Good	0
8419	Update - Turned off wi fi, mobile number now accepted. Maybe this info could be on registration page.... Downloaded app ok on 27/4. Tried to register, but app won't accept my mobile number, tried with and without leading zero. Says the number is invalid. Can't go any further, no troubleshooting options available.	1
8420	Good response	0
8421	Battery Draining due to GPS need to turn on all the time, while Bluetooth automatically on simultaneously. If turned off GPS, continuous notification sound comes. Similarly, thus Bluetooth turned off intentionally, due to installed app, it automatically turn on again. please fix the issues. App is good except above parts.	1

8473	Added cross-check. Great idea. Good app.	0
8474	This app is completely pointless. Mine has to be reinstalled every couple of days after which it will carry out exposure checks for a day or 2 and then completely stop. I could have been in contact with numerous people and had to self isolate but I dont know because the app isn't doing the checks.	1

8519	This app does not have accurate data regarding case locations, one day it shows cases in 1 city and other day it clears it. Lot cases have been confirmed in Nawabshah, Hala, Shikarpur, Larkana but app does not bother to update it (may be because it is run by federal system!)	1

8531	Recently started to require all sorts of additional information (and phone permissions), with no good reason why stated. Includes full name, DOB, NRIC, etc. Defeats the initial intention and purpose of "lightweight"/"minimum info" tracing. Feels like full blown surveillance. Uninstalled for that reason. Such a shame.	1
8532	Badly effected on my phone, my husbands phone and my daughter phone depleted batteries almost instantaneously -had no choice had to removed it from all phones even though I was a supporter of the app.	1

8542	Mobile number is invalid. I've only had the number for 15 years or so :) Disappointing that there's a glitch. Update: 30 April success at last. If you're having probs registering. Uninstall the app, turn off WiFi, use mobile phone data to download and register the app instead. Make sure you've completed all details and use a zero in front of your Aust registered mob num. That is, first two digits are 04. Good luck Aus, 2.4 mill downloads and counting :)	1

The family members using iPhones got alert updates ~2 hours later. I -after 18 hours- still no update. Get it fixed guys! Ps.I think there is a mix up of updating frequency between the statistics frame and the 'own' risk frame. The latter seems to update only once a day!!!	0
8550	The app is not signing in, what a waste of time.	1
8551	Listen . Add a colum of daily testing . I'm researching on covid statistics . Please add daily testing section. This is a betrayal of Indian citizens by not showing daily tests. I'll delete this app if you'll not add testing section in one week.	0

8643	Drains the battery with constant Bluetooth scanning. I believe scanning should happen less frequently or when location changes.	1
8644	Great app but I noticed that the notifications I receive, don’t match what’s in the app when I go into it. Ex: notifications say there’s 2 potential exposures but no reports in the app.	1

8652	Since for a week I checked often this app no matter where I go in Zurich region. There is no warning, no updates of the regions where possibly had COVID-19 before. What is the point of this tracing map?! Radios /TV news update muscle faster.	1

8692	my cannot login	1
8693	I had some fun getting this installed to begin with.. The app didn't like my mobile phone number, but then I had a sudden brain wave and removed numbers from my user nick name. Then everything was smooth sailing. This app is an incredibly important corner stone of our country's response to COVID 19. The uptake of this app will determine how quickly social distancing restrictions are eased.	1
8694	Many people with perfectly usable smartphones like the iPhone 6 want to downward the app and use it, but cannot because of the need for ‘updated’ phone operating systems.\n\nWe are shooting ourselves in the foot of a version compatible with older phones is not made available!!!\n\nPlease consider this requirement.	1

8716	Over the last few days the app is causing a massive drain on the battery needs to be addressed. Very slow to update the statistics shouldn't be that hard. Oh wait it's the HSE	1
8717	Very informative & Useful App. Yes, it is consuming battery power, as it expects the Bluetooth to be always ON, of course, this is a genuine reason.	0
8718	Says my phone number is invalid. I double checked my phone number. Still comes up as invalid.. Update. Monday 22st September Still says my phone number is invalid.	1
8719	I just kindly wanted to ask about the recently update of the ehteraz app. Because in my phone I already updated my ehteraz app in the app store. But when I open my ehteraz its has the note " please update your app". I also try to restart my phone and check again but nothing happens. It's still the same. Is it my phone the problem? What should I do? Some other public place demands the updated app. I already updated my app but My ehteraz doesn't have the "name" . I only have the "time/date".	1
8720	Simple app but you cant go back on the symptom check in, so of you make a mistake you are marked as having a symptom	0
8721	App won't work without having location services turned on, even though it claims not to use location services. I don't use location services for a variety of reasons, so I can't use this app. Evidently, on Apple phones it works without location being turned on, don't understand why...	0

8739	I agree this App is important for all Australians for the short term. What I did NOT allow was permission to access my location! I was lead to believe that users were not tracked and only Bluetooth required to 'handshake' with others. A friend also installed at the same time using an Apple device but NOT asked to access their location. I'll uninstall until there's clarification and the location requirement is disabled.	0

8747	Unable to receive otp	1
8748	The app keeps on crashing just a moment after I open it. It made my phone overheat and it drains the battery. The worst, it's not even working and always saying "ERROR REQUESTING OTP... TRY AGAIN." And I did, more than ten times and still nothing. Pls if you're gonna require this for public use, at least fix it. We can't even go to grocery store without this!	1

8760	I'm one of the people who deleted the app due to excessive battery drain. The issue was sorted in conjuction with Google who were involved with the development of the app in the first place. My phone is now back to where it was, giving me just short of two full days on a single charge with normal daily usage. Very happy with the app.	1

8775	Bloody Useless. I downloaded day 1 but now uninstalling due to battery/Bluetooth hogging. While I'm happy to do my part, this app just shows how terrible the Aus govt. is in the tech space. Custom built app, understably rushed but not supported, improved or optimised. They need to leverage apps that have actually worked in other countries (like Germany). I also have a sinking suspicion they know it's broken but don't want to say so publicly. Don't bother.	1

8809	Hi there, I'm using Samsung Note 10plus, android version 10. The issue I'm facing is it doesn't allow me to add other family members into my account. The tracetogether version for Android is 2.3.11 while the version in IOS is 2.4 which allows user to add other family members to their account. Possible to rectify the issue for Android users. By the way, I've sent an email too. Thanks	1

PLUS save your frequent visited location under FAVORITES and just tap for immediate check in. No need to look for QR code at the location. SUPER - group check in for family. No need to scan one by 1.

8823	This App is not designed for th UK, it is designed only for Gibraltar the app is useless, contact the developer like i did, UK citizen you will be told we can't use it in the UK ???? This is their response "This App has been developed specifically with Gibraltar in mind. It is open for download by anyone, including cross-frontier workers and persons who regularly visit Gibraltar. If you are not in Gibraltar (whether residing, working or visiting) this app is of no real use to you"	1

Then you can turn off your Bluetooth & Location. You don't need to turn it off while you are outside of your house. This is mandatory, to warn you from person with Covid 19 positive around you.	0

8842	Easy to install	0
8843	The battery drain issue happens again after patch update. This is totally unacceptable.	1
8844	This app could be even more helpful if it were to have a functionality to manually (or automatically) track the places and people you have been in contact with. This can be done maybe with notes or daily questionnaire or daily schedule import- so if you get infected you have a better overview of the people you have been in close contact and are able to notify them. This app can be useful, only problem is that bluetooth drains the battery a lot.	1
8845	Very bad app	1
8846	No instructions on how it works	1
8847	Everytime we have to enter the details to login, also test details are not given.	1
8848	So a man tests positive his wife negative. Together they are now in quarantine. The app has never given her a warning that she has been close to a covid possitive person. Could this app just be a placebo? Now i don't know if this app will have my back when i'm outside...	1
8849	I really don't know what's use of this apps except eating so much battery juice on my phone.	1
8850	spotify lags and pauses intermittently when tracetogether is used. also drains battery. checkouts used to be reset by midnight, does that not happen anymore? can all check ins be seen so that checking out can be facilitated?	1

8866	Great app that will help us save lives and help the health officials decide on the restrictions. I strongly suggest that people read the help page on the app. Android/Google requires all apps that request access to Bluetooth\u00ae to also obtain location permission. As a result, COVIDSafe on Android asks for location permissions because they are needed for Bluetooth\u00ae permissions. COVIDSafe does not store or use location data on Android. For more information, read the Android developer guide.	0
8867	Not able to scan always error on no internet connection	1
8868	The fact that they ask for a phone number is very dumb as travellers from other continents mostly will get another sim card or won't be able to use theirs overseas. Bc of that, no results.	1
8869	There is nothing wrong with the app. The negative reviews are from people who didn't read that registrations only opened from a certain time. They have now been opened and it works perfectly fine.	1
8870	I use Samsung (android). Upon entering EID and phone number, it gave me an error "Account Creation failed". Also with this app, shall we delete the other app by Department of Health in AbuDhabi "TraceCovid"?	1

8906	Less than 30 seconds to install and register. If you have ever had anything to do with Aus Gov they already have more info than this app provides them with. I used a pseudonym no problem. It doesn\u2019t ask to use your location services (so no, it\u2019s not a \u2018tracking app\u2019) it only uses Bluetooth signals to ping off other app users (that\u2019s why it asks you to keep app running in background and Bluetooth on).  You enter your mobile number so if a user is diagnosed and they upload their data which has used Bluetooth to ping other users (in close proximity for more than 15mins) by putting our mobile numbers in, it allows the health dept. to be able to contact us, not by using a location service.  If you have any app on your phone that uses location services it\u2019s more invasive than this one. You have to upload your data for it to be accessible, otherwise it is kept on your phone. Even if it did use location services (which it doesn\u2019t) I\u2019d rather give access to the govt of my location for a couple of months than potentially be in ICU, or be responsible for someone else being in ICU.	0
8907	Has anyone got notified by this app? What was described is a really good ideology, You dont know whats going on beyhond the wall. Yet, the app is piece of **. Drains battery, no optmization tech, Poor design and many more. It would be better if covid check-in services would have been deployed on the app.	1
8908	What's wrong ???? Isn't working	1
8909	This app just doesn't seem to work in my class three people were infected by Corona and the whole class went on a quarantine but it did not give me any notification i don't have Corona but i think it's important that this app works quick and I'm not gonna have a app which is just useless and is driving my battery down cuz of Bluetooth .	1

8927	So slow	1
8928	Good app	0
8929	Battery killer. Was working fine, up until yesterday, with no affect on battery. Now it is destroying my battery, using it all up in a few hours. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling, but hasn't fixed it. App is unusable until this is fixed. Which, considering the point of the app, is sub optimal, to say the least.	1
8930	The application doesn't allow to enter date of birth either Hijri or Georgian. Kindly fix this problem as early as possible.	1
8931	What's wrong with this application is that the government has to shut down our phone battery and let the government fix it	1
8932	Key in NRIC vut system doesnt recognise. Prompt enter a valid NRIC. Re-enter many times. Not working. Bad app!	1
8933	Awesome ðŸ‘�ðŸ˜Š	0
8934	A red herring. App does not stay in background despite following instructions to give permissions on my Huawei P30. There has to be a better solution in such times	1
8935	Site would not identify my mobile phone number, after many attempts. Very frustrating! Please remedy this problem!m8	1
8936	why i cant see my health. only question mark	1
8937	I keep getting push notifications from the app but have no idea if it is telling me I've been near someone who's tested positive or not. Why aren't the notifications clear? I now have no clue if I should be isolating or booking a test	1
8938	Not working	1
8939	Sent me the OTP but app detect as wrong number. Keyed correct NRIC no but system said invalid..... Good job!!!	1
8940	When i received the OTP to register my phone number, the OTP number was trancated. I have to go to my sms to view the OTP number. However, when I return to the TraceTogether app it led me to the beginning for me to set my phone number again. Very frustrating and i can't register at all. Why this smaller common problem is being overlooked? Very disappointed.	1
8941	Very useful this app very good	0

8943	Sudden disconnection in bluetooth headphone when watching movie in my phone since I installed this app. Bluetooth connection seems to disappear from time to time.	1
8944	So fricking stupid! After installing fm google play, i followed the screen instructions/ wizard. I got a password (numeric) but instead of completing the installation, a screen that say "share the app" shows up. I cant skip this step, its "forces" ppl to share n if i dont, i cant skip the step either. N thats it, the installation just stops here. Is the installation complete, i dont know\ud83d\ude25. So whats supposed to happen next... \ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd26??! Did the developing team test run this\ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd14?	1
8945	Same as everyone else. Killing my battery. Myself, my husband and our neighbours all have had to uninstall it. Shame as we did have it from day 1. Might re install if issue is fixed.	1

8950	Massive Battery Drain and Overheating. Irish media saying fix has been rolled out yet this app hasn't been updated since July 15th. Google play services also not updated in a long time. Has this been fixed yes or no????	1
8951	I love you and your services.	0
8952	Well	0
8953	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
8954	This app can't even send OTP on time....how can i expect this to send me COVID alert. Completely Useless app, just installed as per govt. protocol.	1
8955	The app is affecting my bluetooth headset audio. Intermittent audio occurred and pausing the app bluetooth does not help. I need to uninstall the app in order to resolve the problem. Please resolve so that i can install again.	1

8964	Very good	0
8965	Why stopped me using this app when my phone got root access?	1
8966	I have only disabled bluetooth and enabled. The App cannot be reactivated and keeps stopping everytime I try to open it. I will be obliged to reinstal it. Booring. This is already the third time. It is absolutely necessary to have an App like this but if it continues I will remove it.	1
8967	It seems to work, and I really hope it does.. it is simple, and not intrusive. I look forward to seeing his it pans out.	0
8968	Needs fixing as it drains battery will re install then	1
8969	Easy to use	0
8970	No issues with the app. Security issues may arise with other apps as you need bluetooth on. But 99.9% of us already have it on... :-) I'm good to go with protecting myself and others..	0

8977	Contact tracing section keeps turning covid app off. All phone settings are correctly switched on but unfortunatly this part of the app has a mind of its own. Useless app for me unfortunately.	1
8978	Was working ok and then bang all of a sudden my battery drained by 80 per cent in 2 hrs. Checked my battery tool and it said that this app had been running solid for over 2 hrs and had drained the majority of my battery. Also made my phone go really hot. Uninstalled.	1
8979	Helpful	0

8981	Latest up date with a QR scanner but can't even scan any... keep saying not a QR code. Headache using it. Why did you take away to barcode which link to our infor ?

9031	not working	1
9032	Very bad app, doesn't get updated automatically. 10 times reinstalled. Still the app is not working.	1
9033	App itself functions OK. \n\nHowever have found only 1% of places I visit have the NZCovidTracer QR code printed & on display. There is no ability to manually add a location that does not have a QR code. \n\nAs a result this app is useless & will likely delete. Poor execution, I’m afraid. \n\nYou either need buy in by NZ wide business, or an ability of users to fill in gaps manually.\n\nIt would also be good to be able to review own movement history, so gaps can be filled in.	1
9034	superb.	0
9035	Failed to get OTP code after several attempts. I had also removed and download the apps again and restart my phone but still failed to get the OTP code to log in.	1
9036	Battery drain in the app was so bad that my phone was draining in a few hours instead of the usual 2 days I get out of it. I had to uninstall	1
9037	A complete violation of privacy that isn't optimized at all. So if I don't allow the government access to thing sthey shouldn't need to see I can be fined? Orwell would be proud.	1
9038	Great app. It just works fine compared to others. New version is covered all necessary to updates, such a short period of time, Ministry is able to develop this app that fetchs data from hospitals and health institutions. ??	0
9039	Worst due to power consumption	1
9040	Great solution! I am impressed by how well the app and tracing system was designed. It's impressive how the design allows to both ensure absolute privacy of all users while still being able to track infection chains anonymously. Good work!	0

9058	Good App regarding the usage for contact tracing for the current Pandemic. Suggestion: options like SafeEntry/Exit QR-Code Scan, ID BarCode and list of Visited Places is not available for non-locals. Perhaps you may want to add this feature to all users of TraceTogether. Keep up the good work, Team. Stay Healthy and Stay Safe.	0

9065	App frequently stops. Bluetooth switches off unexpectedly. These issues together with the fact that it depends on close proximity for an extended period of time makes the app ineffective for its intended purpose. As stated elsewhere in these reviews, it only takes the time for a sneeze or a cough to become infected. Still have it installed but not as optimistic as those in power are. A very disappointing app.	1
9066	Bad app	1
9067	Dont like it. Consume a lot of battery power.	1

Typical government can't get a bloody app right that works for everyone. And they want you to download app, what a joke!!!!!	1
9092	Bad	1
9093	Update: Lots of Improvement. However, the data transparency portion need improvement. E.g. Allow user to refresh to update the number of contacts made. 1. Interference with other bluetooth devices. 2. No simple data transparency to encourage users. E.g. "Congrats you have maintained social distancing today" 3. No data insights. E.g. a simple bar chart can make us aware of our social distancing effort and make improvement. 4. No option to allow us to turn off when at home.	1

9108	When the app is installed and I'm connected to a device with Bluetooth and playing music, the music seems to cut out a lot. When the app is not installed it works fine.	1
9109	After the latest update the app doesnt open and keeps on closing. Kindly look into it. EDIT:-Was fixed in the next patch but the recent update introduced the same issue	1
9110	find it diffucult to download	1
9111	App not active unless battery optimization is disabled. Unfortunately my phone turns optimization back on again every time I disabled it. It should be "set and forget" instead of having to do this every time I am going out. No good as it is.	1

9121	It Help to find your swab test result..	0
9122	The app is isn't bad it's the settings in our phone that aren't good. Everyone who has the problem of the app stopping go to settings in your phone, then open app settings, open ehteraz, under ehteraz open storage, under storage clear data and clear cache as well. After all the above go back to the app and restart your app. Thank me later.	0
9123	The app says you're safe if you say you have no symptoms. It requires you to have your Bluetooth turned on at all times. Absurd. Privacy risk for sure	1
9124	Good app	0
9125	Great idea & was easy to install. Only concern is that hopefully bluetooth constantly on doesnt drain the battery too much? Time will tell.	0
9126	(Because some people are asking how to change the interface language: for me this worked by changing the preferred system language in my Android settings.) It was extremely simple to get this app going. I thought the whole privacy statement at the start was halfway understandable as well, and good that you are asked to read it. I also tried how it works with generating the R1 code in case I went to get a test, and then resetting the app afterwards.	0
9127	Nice but doesn't seem reliable..it doesn't show much cases in or around my area in Lahore...can you tell us how much reliable is this and does confirmed cases pins move everyday ? Cuz they tend to disappear....make it more precise please and I think it's not better to delete pins....I am from lhr Tajpura	1

Not sure why so many people are having trouble with their phone numbers...possibly forgetting to drop the zero from the front. Also, people complaining about gps/location being needed don't seem to understand how the app works. If you use Google or Facebook, your having much more data collected than this app!	0

9139	Why this application can't be installed in ios 12.4.7??? And i have try to install in android 5.0.1 also can't be open. Who are developing this apps must understand if most mobile in qatar still using old version of software. Don't make difficulties to resident if really goverment want to implementing this program againts the virus. Everyone must get easier access to grant this Ehteraz application. So, every one in country can support.	1

9156	Nice	0
9157	Great! Works as expected!	0
9158	I installed it just so I could help, but it broke my notification overlay on the lockscreen(S8 Android 9 One UI). I do not mind it running on background, but should have settings to hide or show notifications like all other apps. Very bad UI design, had to uninstall it.	1

9170	Samsung a50 user. Love the app as in, it scans very fast compared to just using hp's camera or qr scanner. Nice to hav my check ins in a list, easier to choose/see which to check out from. But it's cause a lot of disconnection/staggered connection issues with my bluetooth headphone. It's very annoying.. I hope this issue the app cause to other bluetooth devices can be fixed soon. UPDATE: I'd give a Zero star now if i can.. i JUST update the app, and realize it pings ZERO exchanges now! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f	0

9185	useful	0
9186	Keeping the bluetooth on at all times not only drains the battery but also heats up the phone real quick.	1

9197	Same experience as many other when connected to audio devices. If CovidSafe is running the audio cuts off every 10 to 20 seconds. The app need to be killed before listening to music.	1
9198	The App is great for tracking, however it would be good to be able to breakdown into the figures a bit more. On cases, deaths etc, it would be good to see where hotshots and outbreaks are. Currently in Kildare the % of cases is 6 % of total. But where in kildare? We should be able to click into kildare and then go into the towns within kildare and see how many deaths, cases have occurred. In this way it will remind us to be extra vigilant if there are rising cases in our town or area.	0

9233	Great concept and is safe	0
9234	I used this for a while until I realised it was the cause of all my Bluetooth sound problems - it makes all my music playback via Bluetooth skip frequently for 1-8 secs or so. Uninstalled it and all is fine again. Edit: Developers response seems to be standard reply for everyone reporting this problem. What other details do they need?! There is apparently widespread BT interference in this app that uses BT scanning. Happening on all our latest Samsung phones, Android 10.	1
9235	Is it updating in realtime ? Also the map is not working at least it should be able to get my location and track icon is not functional at all.	1
9236	Sir it's very good .but now my app ETHIREAZ is not downloaded. I try more but still not .now what I do .plz	1
9237	Worst app, use more data than games. Use less than 30min ady 0.97gb. Keep running in the background, 1 hr drop 15% battery. IT need to do something to improve better user experience.	1

9269	Installed - "GPS must be always on" - deleted it. Claiming privacy first, but requiring GPS to be on to work in combination with Internet access is not privacy. Big Brother / Google - type of privacy is a no go. Btw, for BLE device scan you could have used: "Bluetooth.Adapter.getDefaultAdapter().startDiscovery()" to avoid need for GPS, but you didn't, so it's a conscious choice to violate privacy principles.	1

9292	Totally useless and unusable due to incompetent design. There is no registration process offered, or discoverable, only a catch-22 login process. This is basic 101 IT failure. Whatever Minister is responsible should be sacked and the supplier fired and sued. If I was running this contract they would not have got paid a penny for this garbage. The supplier - no doubt an offshore company like Rishi Sunak's in-laws - is defrauding the UK taxpayer and treasury, plain and simple.	1

9304	Waste my time.	0
9305	Great initiative in this challenging times. But this app limits the use of bluetooth earphones. Couldn't connect to the earphones after setting up the app.	1
9306	Someone I know said they were feeling 4 symptoms on the app so we could actually see if the app notifies anybody else that they have been in contact with someone experiencing symptoms and over a period of 3 days not a single notification on my app or anyone else that he was in contact with (people he lives with & his collegues) and the HSE hasnt contacted him either. So to sum up in my personal experience this app is to make everyone feel safe, but when actually tested will fail.	1
9307	This app only works if your phone has BLE.	1

9336	I think this app is a brilliant idea so long as many people use it. I am 12 years of age and have an underlying condition. Its a rare condition and i am not sure if i am considered vulnerable or not. Because of this i am being as careful as possible. The minute i heard the app was launched i downloaded it but sadly it said that i am too young to use it. Just because i am under 16 it will not let me use the app. Government please reconsider this as people of all ages have underlying conditions.	0

9362	Dear Sir, I have a problem in login the aarogya setu. Please help.	1
9363	It worked without issues on an iPhone XS. to those that espouse issues around privacy just remember that your decisions have ramifications beyond just you. If this fails then it\u2019ll fail because people like you are choosing to make it fail. Let me know later if privacy is that important while passing away from COVID because we as a country couldn\u2019t trace the person you caught it from due to oercieved privacy issues.  For those that have highlighted technical issues around the software you are letting perfection be the enemy of fit for purpose. I want this now, not in 4weeks time. I\u2019m not employed by the Federal or State Government's directly or as a contractor. I am an IT guy.	0

I'm experiencing just one issue on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom running ColorOS 6: although I've already given the app permission to run on background and ignore battery optimisation settings, it still shows a "x". Maybe this issue can be fixed by not trying to detect battery optimisation permissions on ColorOS because I think it's not classified as such.	1

9427	I installed it, but I was getting an alert from the app that said my Bluetooth was off when I had been leaving it on. Maybe the app or other Bluetooth devices I was using interfered and switched the Bluetooth off. I couldn't remove the alert or turn the Bluetooth back on. I had to shut down the phone and restart. My phone is around 5 years old and an Android. It's not really usable for me.	1

9432	Works really well, haven't seen a single bat since activating! \ud83d\udc4d Jokes aside, the ability to track and trace the virus is a very clever and worthwhile use of technology, this will definitely save lives.

9446	Severely interfered with the Bluetooth performance on my phone, making my headphones nearly unusuable.	1
9447	Bast ap	0
9448	Good app	0
9449	It is so good	0
9450	After the app was installed my phone and other devices that were already paired started to notify me that they were trying to connect again. I could not find anyway to stop this so i had to uninstall it	1
9451	Good	0
9452	Why I can't download EHTERAZ??	1
9453	it crushes Huawei phone system by active the mistouch prevention function all the time- if you hv turned this function up,u hv to uninstal this app of unlock your phone manually by pushing Volume up and power key and sliding up the screen all at the same time.	1
9454	Wow happy me.. This app is very good... Health is good.. Good work.. World's number one app ehthiras.. Very nice app thanks qatar team.. Very thanks	0
9455	I used this but I didn't get the purpose of this app	1
9456	app is easy to use and understand. privacy is kept safe and i recommend everybody get this as a safety measure to keep the curve flat. i’m in healthcare and we do NOT need a second wave. cheers!	1
9457	When i received the OTP to register my phone number, the OTP number was trancated. I have to go to my sms to view the OTP number. However, when I return to the TraceTogether app it led me to the beginning for me to set my phone number again. Very frustrating and i can't register at all. Why this smaller common problem is being overlooked? Very disappointed.	1
9458	Excellent	0
9459	Easy to install. Great initiative to help keep everyone safe.	0
9460	Is it going to notify me whenever im near a red spot ?	1
9461	Good app	1
9462	I can't get OTP after I keying my phone number , pls solve it out ...	1
9463	Interesting and useful app. Hopefully more people uses this	0
9464	Works well, easy set up, can change app permission preferences without breaking the app if you're concerned, and it's a simple first name last name age range and phone number info required. So it's honestly nothing to stress about. Let's stay safe guys \ud83e\udd19	0
9465	i love ehteraz	0
9466	very nice app to keep update	0
9467	It works as intended. Without collecting and storing unnecessary data	0
9468	Works well, not intrusive, updates automatically. Does what it's supposed to do. Plus, a nice place to see simple relevant statistics on Covid in Belgium	0
9469	Very kindly useful tracking app But update some that's one cure more much better Thanks Qatar all government departments hard work	0
9470	Not easy 2 install and use	1
9471	Exposure checked almost 3 weeks ago, so not helpfull. Drains battery alot.	1
9472	Cant get a pin to verify my mobile ph no. Error message: invalid phone number. Tried with and without 0 before the other numbers. Cant proceed. Stupid product. Developed in haste. Dont get these monkeys to write the code for your space mission to Mars, your space craft will blow up on the way to the launchpad!	1
9473	The app keeps shutting down every day.It must be something in the settings that does it----? I give up. GRRR.	1
9474	Nice user interface, but always force close when open the application to check the area which is the red zone	1
9475	draining battery, forced by the government with no overall results EDIT: battery drainage is not objective (actually showing 0% battery usage no matter how long since the last full recharge), but reported by many that with the app on, battery lasts way shorter time; app is also not "forced" but heavily recommended by many experts, unfortunatelly data are not used basically at all as acknowledged by govt itself	1
9476	No alert given for App update. No weekly alerts given for 2 consecutive weeks	1
9477	Downloaded app. In two minutes the OTP expires and does not allow end user to reinstall app. 2nd time no OTP number given for verification. Same with mother's and sister's phone. 1st time entering pin no. it says incorrect. Which is odd given we had quickly written the 6 digit numbers needed. While app is to assist in tracing, to upload is user unfriendly	1
9478	This app is non effective	1
9479	This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.	0
9480	This app is worth download. It is essential incase you going to crowded places like malls, Railway station, Airport etc	0
9481	Highly recommended. This app may save your life.	0
9482	Who's the developer for this app? It sucking up all my battery \ud83d\udd0b, it is not a good app and Bluetooth & GPS is on and uncontrollable.	1
9483	Currently I'm working in a construction project and I kept my Bluetooth always on, although I received a notification that says my trace together app is working well but still my history is zero for last 14 days. What's the issue..?	1

9490	Useless app Any one can give wrong answer and make a fool out of other from the app.	1
9491	Good app. Good intiative. \n\nThere seems to be a bug on the first instance of registering phone number. \n\nError message is “Error verifying phone number. We have blocked all requests from this device due to unusual activity. Please try again later”\n\nClosing the app and reopening resolves this. \n\nPlease note.	0
9492	Very good!	0

9506	I used it for over a month since the exact hour it was launched. It does not work as less than 5 % only of population I use it... I made the PCR test 3 weeks ago, and got the result after less than 24h by SMS end Mail. It is still not available as per coronalert, despite I had registered the long code. So useless, except for helping killing the battery. Uninstalled today...	1
9507	Mobile number invalid and can't go further. Same as others. Update: tried again at different time and registration works.	1
9508	Shocking impact on performance and Bluetooth interface management. We need a decent app. Start with good requirements and follow with professional execution and thorough testing	1
9509	Irresponsible that qr code check-in has not been implemented. Australians are losing their private data to third parties. The government needs to step up, and protect the privacy of Australians, and provide a safer means to qr code check-in.	1

9513	There is no work.	1
9514	Given that this piece of shoddy programming works only within one single member-state of the European Union - where to make things worse hardly anybody has installed it - the app, for the moment, is a complete waste of space.	1
9515	Unable to install app on oppo A9. Can't be found on app store. Error says "app not available in the region".	1
9516	The app worked fine for 14 days straight, then gave an error (something to do with an sqlite database query not being successfully executed). The app kept crashing and I had to uninstall and re-install it. This means I lost all my Exposure records? Giving a 3/5 just because the rating is required.	1
9517	While i am putting my num, QID and expiry date that time( error requesting OTP try again) i will get this message so kindly help me.	1

9525	Thank you for the app but is it possible to add the contact tracing as well? Will it alert us if the person who we had recent contact with was tested positive? Hopefully the system will. Be sync twice or thrice a Day to get accurate info. Overall, thank you Bahrain, you are doing a great job????	0
9526	This is scary entresting app.	0
9527	Not at all a reliable app. This app says the person with this number is COVID positive even when i have never got my self tested from any ICMR certified lab and i am health Not even a little bit of cold.I was barred for visiting some places just because the app says i am COVID positve	1
9528	This app does not work. I constantly get this message "please make sure your information is accurate" I only have to enter my ID number and date of birth. Trust me they're very accurate!!!!	1
9529	Excellent app. Gives global stats too. Very useful. Must have.	0

9536	I have been trying to access this app in British Columbia since the beginning of the pandemic and even now it still doesn't work in BC. Figure it out Canada. #FAIL	1
9537	Installed for 2 days and work fine, but today crash everytime I'm open the apps. Please fix this.	1
9538	Good software.	0
9539	It looks a great app, the only reason I've felt need to knock off 1 star was as has been mentioned in other reviews already, the app was near impossible to find. Took long enough time to find it and it was more by luck. Even by going through the link in the covid ni app and using link there came up as error. by typing in the name of this app correctly it still wouldn't appear. Actually found it by typing in stop and scrolling and scrolling. Needs to appear easier.	0
9540	Constant disconnection with my sony wf-1000xm3 on my OnePlus 7 Pro.	1
9541	Again, on the android, the screen is not displayed properly. It is too large and is cut off. This was fixed for a day or so but again it is not displaying correctly. What good is the app if I cannot read what it sayd clearly.	1
9542	Works fine	0
9543	Not able to create a new account!	1

9546	Does not work. Repeated OTP failures and does not validate FIN details. Useless. Uninstalled. Would have given zero stars if it would be possible.	1
9547	As with a lot of other users, I am experiencing battery drain with this app. On a nearly new Samsung A70 that would usually last 3-4 days on a charge, now only last almost 24 hours. This app is now uninstalled. Trust is a very important value between developers and users and I am sad to say, you have just lost my trust.	1
9548	Drained my battery today. Please investigate possible bug. Update: Drained again...uninstalling now. I need more than half a day of battery...	1

9563	I hope the Devs can fix the issue with this app killing Bluetooth headsets, I need my Bluetooth headset working as I'm on the phone for hours per day. Maybe even a pause button if the headset wireless issues can't be fixed.	1

9566	Pls remove the notification that always shows on the notification bar. It's very annoying.	1
9567	App is rubbish. Phone number is invalid	1
9568	It was the best thing ever when it first came out.. Now I think everyone else has it so it drains my battery as it continuously poll's Bluetooth devices as I am always around large amounts of people.	1
9569	Nice black theme implementation, I like it! Some of the preliminary text could be condensed and the full counterparts moved into menus though, currently it's long and tedious to read through. Once you're past that, the interface looks intuitive though. Good work!	0
9570	The app is good initiative but its has too much flaws.. the battery, the app itself, and your up penalty? How about the ones with visit visa.. they can't apply.. i hope there is a modification that allows the visitors to access app and be safe..	1
9571	App is great but my sister has a problem with her phone. The whole User Interface for keypad entering her password doesn't show at her whole screen. She can't type 0,* and # cause it wasn't show at her screen. Thanks	1

9573	Smashed the battery	1
9574	Good app	0
9575	When I downloaded this app over the 3 days I noticed my Wi-Fi speed on the phone was 50% less then normal. At the same time all my tablet with Bluetooth device was affected. Including my work laptop. When i uninstalled it my Wi-Fi and all device internet speed was back to normal as in not 50% less. Does this mean this app has some affect on neighbouring home tablets phone laptops with Bluetooth affecting the Wi-Fi speeds?	1

9584	It's written it needs Bluetooth ON all the time, Ok for that, it's the way it works. But it also requests GPS autorisation to be ON all the time, leaving other apps to potentially drain battery! Disappointed that the government together with our polytechnic schools weren't able to make something clean. Only reason to accept it is for protecting society.	1

9597	The fact that this always turns on your Bluetooth and aggressively runs in the background with the notification is a BATTERY DRAINER MONSTER. Their might be a better algorithm for contact tracking, NOT THIS ONE. As an ICT professional, I'm not convinced the way it perform as contact tracer. Sorry but that is how i experienced it and better to uninstall. Salmat	1

9619	Seriously, there is no better way to generate data. As well as informing everyone where the Dreaded Rona IS, this app also makes it known how FEW cases there are relative to downloads, and where covid is NOT. This is the best way to prove that the panic is much bigger than the crisis.	1

9624	The idea deserves praise. It would be good, though, if the app gave some kind of indication (if you ask for it) that it's working/doing anything at all. For example show how many other devices it has communicated with. So that you get a feeling that it's actually working.	0

9633	While I was signing up the app, it was written that my ID number is associated with another account. How can that be possible? Does this mean sb. else is using my ID number?	1
9634	A great app for business tracing. Would it be possible to add a QR generator bit so that you can scan the QR code of a personal contact and track when you were with them? It’s hard to remember otherwise.	0

9640	I have reported for an issue through twitter support account, it has been resolved and an update pushed within less than 24 hours. Great management behind the scene taking care of the users experience. Thanks to all of you.	0
9641	This should be given a negative star. The first day after installation, it drained my phone battery from full charge to less than 10 percent overnight when I slept, note that it wasn't even launched and actively running. I have uninstalled it, despite being forced to download it in the first place.	1
9642	Very convenient	0
9643	All good	0
9644	Takes a very long time to download and set up. Spent two days downloading the app and two more days trying to set up the app to no avail. I can't even get past the otp verification because of how long the app takes to load and this leads to me having to retype my phone number numerous times and the app sending multiple otps to my sms.	1

I have not got calls from country unknown to my travel or relations in many years and I am very careful where I give my number if at all.	0
9672	Have had app since Apr start up.....still does not recognise that my phone's battery optimisation is switched off! Therefore app not working when out in general community. Have uninstalled and reinstalled turned phone off and on and the app still not working for more than 12 mins. When I check battery optimisation unchecked. Any suggestions phone is Oppo x5s	1
9673	Doesn't work without giving explicit location permissions, the whole point is that it shouldn't need direct location tracking. Also shouldn't use AWS - it's not like a text file containing a contact list is a lot of data, just send it straight to the state's public health authority rather than through the US. It doesn't matter that you promise not to use the permission, you've already broken our trust with abuse of metadata collection and technical protections are far better than empty assurance	1

9719	I first reviewed the app in June. Three and five months later and nothing has changed. The app has deactivated 3 times in a space of 2 hours. The last time whilst I've been out. I have to uninstall then reinstall. My Bluetooth is left on all the time, so that isn't the problem. What is the point of it ???	1

9755	This app is redundant and it's only purpose is to help drain your battery faster, now electrical bills very expensive you know? So troublesome for what hastily release a flawed app and force everyone to install, don't even get me started on security risks. Might as well just give all of us a tracking device.. oh wait.	1
9756	Not able to register even I received OTP, it says ID Expired, which not correct as my I'd is valid till next year. Tried calling helpline to report problems, but they were also not much of help. Continuously I am putting efforts and chasing them too, but of no use. Stuck at home can't even go out to buy groceries. Please fix this issue.	1

9763	It would be good if the app could alert you to the fact that you have been in close contact with another person to REMIND people about social distancing.	1
9764	There is no reason to have another tracking app unless the previous one worked terribly. This one is clunky and I want it disabled as soon as I close it.	1
9765	The app is downloaded litteraly 0 times but already has reviews with 5 star rating and even a lengthy 'thank you' note. How is this possible? Shame, shame. Hire better trolls or at least wait for 5 downloads before praising it.	1
9766	1. Bluetooth gets turn off automatically after opening the app. 2. When Bluetooth is working, one side of my wireless ear plug will not work.	1

9769	Great idea, terrible implementation. Interferes with Bluetooth streaming, which is frustrating on the train ride home. Needs to be fixed if you want this to be a genuine tool to help contact tracers.	0
9770	This is an amazing step forward back to our old lives.	0
9771	Battery saps very fast because Bluetooth have to be on all the time for the app to work. Why not use GPS signal instead? Or Wifi.	1

9774	So far, so good. No effect on my phone's battery! And no concerns about privacy - this is a well designed app with intelligent features to protect privacy. Everyone in Australia who can use this app MUST use the app. You need to know if you've been close to an infected person & as a nation, we need to survive COVID-19. Any country which eradicates it early will prosper economically versus countries like the USA & China which will suffer from devastating infections for years. Download now please.	0

Please be reassured that the App continues to function in the background a if you have bluetooth and exposure notification and the active notice will reappear at difference speeds depending on phone model etc."	0

9780	When so much is at stake, in terms of lives, livelihoods, all aspects of wellbeing and quality of life, I feel that downloading this app is the least that I can do. I am confident the limited data collected will not be misused and I found the app itself to be really quick and straightforward to download and set up. One of the other reviewers said to omit the \u20180\u2019 when entering mobile numbers to fit with the international dialling format. Maybe this is why I did not experience the same issues as a few others. In any case, it is great to see so many people being proactive about downloading this app. Please let\u2019s all work together and do whatever it takes to beat the coronavirus, look after our communities and help restore health to all aspects of our beautiful nation.	0

9792	HAS DESTROYED MY PHONE BATTERY LIFE. I have one of the best phones for battery life and this app has absolutely destroyed it. My phone battery has went down by 13% in 18 minutes. My battery would usually last me the entire day, now it's due to last for 3 hours. This is disgusting. I'm beyond angry. €1000 phone ruined by 1 app. Are the HSE going to reimburse those that have used this app for the common good, but have been punished by the app destroying their phones??	1
9793	Unfortunately had to delete this app completely as it drained my battery even when phone was charging . Phone was unable to hold a charge with this app . After removing the app i charge the phone while turnef off to get full charge back	1
9794	While this is a great initiative, I don't feel comfortable providing an app access to photos and other personal folders on the phone. If this access is denied, the app simply closes. Can we please have this access request removed or made optional?	1

9812	I just received the notification that I have been exposed within the past 14 days. \nFirst of all - why is it telling me this now rather than informing me that a positive person is around me at the moment when I can be prepared to move away to prevent a spread. Instead it messages me when I’m at home alone that I’m exposed hours later and been around vulnerable family members in the meantime. \n\nSecond of all - there’s no way of knowing my location at the time of exposure. I understand this could prevent identity issues. However, it’s important that I know where I was at the time to trace my steps. \n\nThis app can be much better to prevent the spread. Don’t wait to inform the people. Give constant updates that we’re safe or need to get out of an area. Otherwise this app is just not useful if my only information is “you’ve been exposed”. Needs to be better.	1
9813	Wow so many idiots reviewing this app.. just turn it on, unselect your notifications in the settings you stupid numpties.. bluetooth isn't using any extra battery, I've noticed no difference.. go put your tin foil hat back on and enjoy the restrictions..	1
9814	Edit: Seems to be working again since mid-December. I'm leaving one-star review due to no developer response and extremely long time to fix such a basic problem for such a critical service! Henter ikke længere smitteliste (siden ultimo oktober), medmindre jeg selv starter appen. 22. nov: Hallo er her nogen? Henter stadigvæk ikke smittelisten. 5 ud af 5 tilfældige kollegaer jeg har spurgt har samme problem. Virker det overhovedet for nogen?!?	0
9815	At last, there's a way to pause. But why restrict to 8 hours only. Why not indefinitely until resumed by user? Using NRIC for SafeEntry defeats the purpose of using random number for exchanges. All places I visit get my NRIC. What's the point of a random number?	1

9826	After upgrading my iPhone to the iOS 14, the exposure notification feature does not work anymore. I have reinstalled the App multiple times, but I get the same results. My wife is also having this exact problem. This is clearly because the Developers have not updated the App to be compatible with iOS 14, even though Apple have made the OS available for Developers for months at this point. Much to be desired from an App that was supposed to track COVID-19...	1
9827	Very cheap app	1

9990	Love the idea of the app, very proactive. However unable to verify phone number after 6 p.m. - I am on a Android device. :)	0
9991	I could not start, Error submitting OTP	1
9992	It drains less than 1% of battery in a charge cycle if you have a modern phone with Bluetooth LE, about 7 times less than Google Chrome even when the latter doesn't use Bluetooth at all. Don't believe what the people with outdated phones say LOL	0
9993	Important functionality. Problem is that it is power intensive. I suggest you stop the app when you are at home.	1
9994	I'd downloaded because it's feature of 'Radius Alert' which is not working now. There's nothing special in this app other than that.	0
9995	Tried to sign up but when I put in my phone number I got no verification pin, making the whole app entirely useless. I've tried following the steps on the FAQ but they don't work either. Cant tell if this is an OS issue or something with the app considering in stuck on Android 9	1
9996	Awesome...when it's finalized.	0
9997	Useful and updated. Helping us in avoiding the red zone	0
9998	Useless. Tried to sign but keeps on saying "we are temporarily unavailable"	1

10005	The app is good, BAG isn't. Letting people in from risk countries and i have to use the app to track if i get infected? Absurd	0
10006	Whilst it may help keep us safe it does seem to be at the cost of hogging your bluetooth so nothing else will connect properly. As an essential worker I'm traveling into the city every day(a 2 hr trip) and this app means I can't listen to music. If I'm in the car the connection keeps dropping meaning I can't receive calls if I must. The only reason this doesn't get 1 start is that I appreciate it is to try and keep us safe.	1
10007	This apps cannot scan QR Codes even I uninstalled reinstalled again 2x and tried reset my phone.	1

10011	Too generic however provides some idea	0
10012	Uses a lot of battery on Samsung S7, not even a full day. Requires GPS to be active. I don't use the GPS unless navigating, shouldn't be required as GPS doesn't work inside in any case, and is only supposed to use bluetooth and no tracking. I've uninstalled it, battery now lasts 2 days Also not properly open sourced which is disappointing. Could be so much better, also appears to be limited version control.	1
10013	Maybe the devs should learn geofencing and mesh network. It does using gps and bluetooth. Do not depends on general data by official only. Give an allert when close to "recorded RT" only please. It is not usefull enough and drainning battery UPDATE: another update and should make new login session. So ... I'll just wait and see ... my friends respond	1
10014	just curious why HUAWEI P40 can't download this app. the purpose of this app shall allowed all handphone platform to used it for safety health.	1
10015	I think your data base have some glitches, I've been trying to register, and each time it says YOUR ID EXPIRED...how come...my QID expires on July 31, 2020...and we are only on May 19, 2020 as of this writing...and i can't register until now...and you will fine me QR 200,000 for not being able to registet because of your datas glitches?	1

10040	Interferes with my Bluetooth earpieces. Every time there's a "handshake", my Bluetooth audio connection dropped	1
10041	This app should be force installed to all phones so that everyone is traceable for covid-19 virus.	0
10042	good	0
10043	When I open the app it is in green code color but suddenly it turns into a question mark. So I searched how to fixed it then i follow the instructions like clearing the data and cache, the force stop and the uninstall, reinstall but didn't work. Until the app told me that I exceed the log in attemp and call. But until now its not working. Can you please fix your app urgently because it is mandatory to have this.	1

10056	What started out well has gone in the wrong direction. Can't even register now - keeps saying wrong OTP. Tedious to set up and intrusive, asks for IC date of issue (for what? Not necessary until I've been exposed.) On top of all this I ask myself why I even bother, when this app won't work properly on my friends' iPhones and they've all refused to use it. To Govt and GovTech... can you PLEASE just make use of the Apple/Google COVID-19 framework which is a much more efficient solution.	1
10057	I experienced really poor Bluetooth connection strength (persistent glitches and stutters playing audio from phone to both car stereo and ear buds, with occasional disconnects from car and ear buds) while using this app. Uninstalled the app and back to perfect connection on both car and earphones. What gives?!	1
10058	In the Covid Updates graphic representation, Daily Deceased and Daily Recovery options are not shown clearly.. The chart is only showing in cumulative basis and Daily basis format should be made properly visible.. Please look into this because I usually have a look on it and from last update, it is disappeared.. Please resolve at the earliest.	1

10093	Bad	1
10094	Downloaded the app. Same issue as many others when it kept telling me the phone number I have had for 25 years is invalid. Tried a dozen times. Just did the same to my wife as well. We have both since uninstalled the app. Your have to be kidding!! I'll think about it long and hard in regards to doing this again at all.	1
10095	MaShaAllah Excellent app, all requirements in a nut shell.

10097	I can't go into the app it's says temporary unavailable but I keep trying also cannot I key in my personal info already	1
10098	This seems to be draining more battery than it should. Which means more people wouldn't want to use it when they are out. Optimize this app to use the least amout of battery as possible.	0
10099	You can't change app language after registration. The option is not enabled.	1

10101	Bluetooth is turned on as requested. But there is this permanent notification banner on my home screen and notification dashboard. You don't need to shove your tracetogether notifications down my throat.	1
10102	Garbage spying on us hacks your private info	1
10103	The idea is ok but in practice it doesn't work because it needs too much battery. Think of a way to stop killing the battery and I will check again.	1
10104	I always thought this application design could be really helpful so I yet don't understand what was the core problem with previous version and what has changed now. Anyway I miss the collected data table. This transparency behind actual functionality of the application was really nice so why did you removed it? Thumbs up for the news tab, on point.	0
10105	Thank You	0
10106	After update there’s so much wasted space on image top half while icons and wordings are squeezed in middle section. Please think of larger prominent icon and wordings for those elderly using, don’t just think of ypung people with perfect eyesight.	1
10107	Takes up A LOT of battery. I have to charge my phone several times a day now as compared to having my battery last for more than a day before installing this app. Tried the safe entry NRIC scanning feature once so far... didn't work. Will be better to include QR scanning as well, and also register our ez-link CAN number for much easier contact tracing on public transport!	1
10108	All the citizens of India must download this app . Thankyou.	0
10109	I couldn't log in and it is always temporarily unavailable	1
10110	Oh look they deleted my comment... Security Analysis here. Please take a moment to look at the Assistance and access ACT 2018. Anyone infected is instantly tied to their phone number. From there, their name, ph, and address are all flagged. This is a huge privacy issue. This app should ONLY work through bluetooth, and can be modified to operate without a phone number.	1

10116	To run this app, Bluetooth have to be turned on which drains battery. Beside Bluetooth it also needs permission on wifi and gps which is also causing battery drainage and because if continuous access on wifi, Bluetooth and GPS, other apps seems laging even home launcher sometimes crush. It needs high end processor with inverter system. One star is more enough according to it's service.	0

The government has delivered and now it is our turn to spread the word. This effort only works if many people are using it.

10251	I have read the source code, and I am confident that data privacy is totally secured. Your location will not be tracked, everything is totally anonymous. If your in the same room as someone for 15 mins, you will be marked as a contact for that person. If that person catches covid, your app will inform you of it, allowing you to self isolate and prevent the spread of the disease Do your part by installing this app and keeping your Bluetooth on	0

10255	I am a covid positive patient the phone number I gave while getting tested is the same number that I have used to log in. But still the app says "you're safe". How will anyone on Earth around me will know that I'm positive. Even though I'm being responsible and staying inside.	0

10258	As much as i want to help by using this app, the app simply fails to do its function, as far as in my case. the scan feature just scans and scans and scans and does not actually load any output, the notifications are also quite annoying, and when i turned on the location it malfunctioned and showed the not responding alert	1

10270	The app launches slowly (takes more than 5 seconds) and uses a lot of background RAM (>1GB) and slows down my phone a lot. While running in the background, it keeps crashing. If you're going to mandate the use of TraceTogether, pls make this app more usable.	1

10273	Great app, using it everywhere. BUT why does it log me out? I saw there’s an update but decide not to do that till I’ve got a minute to find my note with the password as I know I’ll need to after updating. But it logged me out even though I didn’t run the update yet. I know I shouldn’t have passwords written down but I simply can’t remember them all and haven’t had time to investigate password apps! Can you stop the app from logging people out - I know it’s happened to others at times too?	1
10274	Very good app i like it very much very use full application Thankyou devolper??	0
10275	I had to uninstall the app as my battery was draining monstrously fast (had to completely recharge my phone 3 times in 24 hours). Will install back once I know this problem has been sorted as it is unfeasable to not have a reliable battery when out and about.	1

10355	Why this app is asking for media or gallery access? Also after downloading this app my Google Duo & WhatsApp call is not connecting properly.	1
10356	In reply to the developers, I hope this helps. My mobile is Samsung Note 20 and using sony wf-1000xm3 for my Bluetooth earpiece. I am beginning to feel that other brands might also be facing the same thing. This means Trace together is lagging or cutting off the sound. If you don't do something, these major brands might start questioning if their customers have to choose between the earpiece or trace together. Hope you can do something. I had shared what....	1

10397	App tells you what to do next if you’ve been exposed, but only if you then get a positive test. I have tested negative after getting an alert but the app seems to be on the alert screen indefinitely. Feels a little “boy who cried wolf” or ineffective when considering I likely risk exposure more than once through the duration of the pandemic. Poorly thought out or not clearly marked if this “reset” feature does already exist.	1

10420	Update: 20/12/20 Battery drainage is still terrible. Still can login multiple devices with one mobile number. 30/11/20 When I sign in the same number on a new phone, all my Favourites does not port over from the profile/account of the old phone, and all my saved Favourites are gone. And when I sign in the same mobile number on a new phone, the old phone does not auto sign out, meaning I could scan 2 or more different places at the same time, with the multiple same Profile/NRIC.	1
10421	I have gotten three alerts. They come every 14 days. The public health people say it gets caught in a loop and keeps goving you false alerts. The other thing they say (and web search of reputable medical journals and popular press articles supports) is that the Bluetooth signal strength is an insufficient measure of distance to assert six feet. Getting an alert can only reasonably be said to mean you were within 20 meters (60 feet) of someone who signaled a positive. Not six feet. Search and read to decide yourself.	1

10502	hi, after the Oct 28 update, my QR code scanner inside the App is no longer working. Scan multiple QR safe entry code and none successful. Lucky I have saved common places I go as favourite. Please check.	1
10503	The App is great	0
10504	Phone battery runs down quicker with the bluetooth constantly scanning. They should put some code in for your home location and a switch so it turns the bluetooth function in the app (just in the app) on and off when you leave and arrive to your home location. Have capability for 2 home locations for kids in a shared care situation. This may save some battery.	1
10505	This is very bad that u maked it only finnish version,u should update it on English	1
10506	I charged my phone to 100% last night and this morning after 3 hours it was below 20% because this app sucked the power out of it	1

10510	Twice i downloaded it but i cannot open. It says the app was stop. Im confused, why it should be asking my files, photo?	1
10511	Really nice	0

10519	My phone number was seen as invalid so I couldn't sign up	1
10520	Nice	0
10521	SOLUTION - INVALID PHONE NUMBER - If you get the "invalid phone number" error do the following - 1) Close the app (don't just minimise it) 2) Turn off WIFI 3) Turn off bluetooth 4) Open the app again and follow the instructions. It should work this time. I entered my full mobile number including the leading 0. 5) Turn on WIFI and bluetooth App Developer - hurry up and fix this critical bug!!! It is affecting many thousands if not millions of people.	1
10522	The battery drain the app causes in recent weeks is actually crippling my ability to take my phone outside. Until they fix this, I don't think I can have this app run in the background. For context, 7 hours run in the background has used 30% of my battery.	1

10530	Not functioning well	1
10531	It’s a useless piece of government surveillance program. I urge you all not to use it as there is evidence that shows that the App does secretly record and store data without your consent.	1
10532	Why its showing "an error has occured. Account creation failed. Please solve this error	1
10533	This app is so invasive on privacy, why it access all your phones functions when app says only bluetooth is required. It drains so much power too on old phones. Please fix your app.	1
10534	Excellent	0
10535	Very cool, facilitates your life with a pandemic. Thank you	0
10536	I would score this higher however, my Wife, who has had the same phone number for 13 years, cannot download the app as her "phone number is not valid". Come on app designers, sort this out. You would get a much higher take up rate if everyone could access it!	1
10537	Good	0

10564	Each time I tried to install the app, it is unsuccessful in its setup when I am supposed to get an OTP. the error message is network connection.	1
10565	App will have an error during registration process when you submit your mobile phone and you used an alias name with a number in it. The error message will say \u201cError verifying phone number\u201d which is not a helpful error message. To fix this, simply change your alias name and remove the numbers or possibly any other special characters in it.	1

10589	App is horrible customized in regards of battery consumption. Drains the battery very fast. Not going to recharge my phone 4 times a day because of an app. Was already expecting this to be honest, all Singapore Government apps I used in the past are all the same. Healthub also a battery draining app. Learn how to code proper. Thank you.	1
10590	was ok.. bit wary of the data its collecting by google.. but like other it killed my phone over the weekend! they saying to re-install now but once bitten twice shy!! I'll install it if i know i'm going out for a few hours of more...	1
10591	Very helpefull app..Thanks MOH	0
10592	Not at all reliable have stopped working for past few days after android update..don't know when the bug will be fixed by Ehteraz team..hope they understand the importance of this app to be functional to access work place and supermarkets.. pls do something asap as we cannot wait for your new releases and live without going for work or groceries... when is the 8.04 release as this issue has typically put us under lockdown everytime this stops it's not feasible to buy new phones...	1
10593	I dont know why it asking updates two days once, does it happens only to me?..	1
10594	Bluetooth issue . When i on my Bluetooth the whole days due to tracing. My phone become haywire and make my phone super hot . I know this app is tracing via Bluetooth but when i off my Bluetooth my phone back to normal . No issue phone not overheat and lagging . Please resolve it	1

10601	Love this app	0
10602	Looking good.	0
10603	Haven't had the app open for a few months, because I thought I would get notified if exposed. Opened it today and got a notification that I have been exposed. I know it couldn't have been from today, so that exposure could have been weeks or months old and I wouldn't know it. The app need to push notifications when not open to actually work! I'm gonna get tested, but in reality I could have exposed so many people without knowing it!	1

10616	The app doesn't work. Keeps on popping up a message that user credentials national ID and DoB isn't correct.	1
10617	Completely useless, you would expect live data and a further breakdown of data within each county all you get is static figures that provide no value! I expect someone got paid a lot of money to create this useless app	1

10619	Nice	0
10620	The app is very good and I never had any problem with it. But since I installed it about 2 months ago it didn't give any warning about people having the Covid19 around me, in which I guess not much people using it.	0

10637	Deceased and recovered graphs are not visible due to use of incorrect colour combination. I mentioned coughing and it is showing me at high risk. I could be having common cold or dust alergy, corresponding options are not there. If I have already got tested, There should be a way to update test ID or SRF no and app should pull results from there. People will lie on test if incomplete options provided. Incomplete app, not reliable. it's been developed so quickly, but not improved for accuracy.	1

I've made sure to exempt the app from battery optimisation, but still it doesn't check in the background. Now it's 16 days since last check, so what is the point? Absolutely and utterly useless!	1

10660	Simple to use, serves a great purpose	0
10661	Worked without a hitch. Just make sure when prompted to enter your phone number to leave out the first 0 otherwise it will not work. (Standard when asked for your phone number and our country code +61 is already entered.)	0
10662	Works perfectly. Don't be concerned about it asking for location. That's just an Android requirement for low powered Bluetooth scanning.	0

10685	So much for being an inclusive country! The stupid app is only in Finnish (not even Swedish which is also official language in Finland)!! How hard was it to translate the menus!! This is made using **my tax money** and yet I'm not considered by the Ministry of Health and whatever dumb company who made such app in 2020!!	1

10709	When I downlaod the app and wanted to set up the app with my particular, i.e. name, IC no. . . The app will validated and respond that my IC no is wrong despite it is the correct data. I had done loading the app and repeat the set up process at least 4 times and still face the same problem. As for the OTP, it is the same too. Even though I had entered the correct OTP, the app still validated and said that the erong OTP had been entered. It is really fustrating depsite I had tried and tried.	1
10710	I got the permit but QR code displaying not allowed during allowed permit time \ud83e\udd14 Permitted time expired and I cannot schedule another appointment in a day!!!	1
10711	Tried 4 times to register it keeps telling me my mobile phone number is not correct ( I give up) my mobile is correct I did it the first time I recieved my code , due to Telstra speed the code had expired and now I recieve the phone number is incorrect message	1
10712	Great app but tells me to turn on exposure notifications i go to settings see exposure notifications i click it, it goes to another page nothing shows up on said page.	1
10713	It is not possible to record a video to confirm my identity because when you tap the Open Cam Recorder button it takes you to the file explorer and not the camera. It is also not possible to record the video saying the numbers and using that because as soon as you exit the app you have to start the whole process again and a different 4 digit number is shown. Extremely frustrating as I cannot complete registration now	1
10714	Error in requesting OPT.....try again. What's really going wrong with this app and some of the colleagues who already have it say that the app makes the phone too hot and battery drains so fast. Please fix this right. Thnx	1
10715	Was stable now keeps crashing despite uninstalling and reinstalling a number of times. Unreliable and not doing the job promised by the government to protect me ! Disappointing indeed.	1

10720	Review of Dan Andrews - just like every labour government before you have FAILED. After speaking to us like children every night despite us already complying, you were asleep at the wheel and cost Australia BILLIONS. You've ruined this country's future and an entire generations opportunity because you can't even control your own team. You are the biggest failure this country every seen and we will be paying your bill for 50 years. Thanks for destroying our future.	1

10724	Not sure if it's me only but the app is causing interference to the proximity sensor to malfunction when i have incoming calls. Phone screen will auto blank out whenever incoming calls are picked up and hence cannot end call or access number pad or turn on speaker mode at all. Because of this i have to uninstall this app until the issue is fixed. I'm using Google Pixel 3A XL. Thanks.	1

10729	Useless as unless positive person consents to uploading they are positive, you will never know if you were close contact. What's the point of this . Positive person should be automatically loaded for contact tracing. Uninstalled	1

10753	This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.	1
10754	Error eventhough I write the correct username and password and the never solve my issue and answer the phone calling so stupid	1

10756	This will be very helpful in times of emergency. Very good idea. Two thumbs up!	0

10770	You should show the active cases how are we supposed to protect ourselves without that. Its critical for the safety of the vulnerable people . This is the only way we can have an understanding of the whole situation. Without the no of cases in an area it gives a false sense of relief. Its better to be safe than being concerned about privacy !	1
10771	It doesn't open radius alert keep on loading	1
10772	I will promote this by maximum	0
10773	App is simple to use and setup however really needs to use the technology developed by Apple & Google to make this app as effective as possible.\n\nPretty sure not using it as there is mention of it or prompts to opt into it...\n\nGiven the situation and probably a whole lot of us installing it now, surprised this isn’t being used...	0
10774	Woow...Nice This App.	0
10775	Amazing!	0
10776	I really hope this is used widely. I also hope that it becomes a more proactive altering service. Telling me about the locations I wish to go to rather than a retrospective alerting system. Clean design and robust app.	0
10777	It drains battery alot. I have to charge 5-6 times in one day instead of 1 time.	1

10784	Kol Hakavod! Great idea, great UIX. Just please make font bigger for older eyes. Devs are responsive, currently app doesn't cross-check *previous* 14 day GPS - only starts collecting history from time of download but developers seem to be working on it. Add option to manually input past location for people who don't carry a phone on Shabbat /walking dog etc	0
10785	I cannot use it because all it does is tell me it is temporarily unavailable.	1

10787	Won't let me sign up, we are told we need to download the app, but we can sign up what's the point. Total waste of time.	1

10789	I wish everyone in Switzerland would install this. As for UX, the English messages could be improved - I sent an email. (Bluetooth must remain on in order to track encounters. Turning on airplane mode? Follow-up by turning on bluetooth. Battery Saver mode also hinders the app.)	0
10790	Have to turn bluetooth off to use wifi for some reason now when at home why I'm not sure. Will forget to turn on/off eventually. Have to allow my location which gives my home address. Been trying to avoid this ever since coroner spolated evidence to cover-up how sister met her end but now this is open info. To what ever gov agency wants location. Born to be hunted. Just don't go wife and kids. Uninstalling as it says location is on while i have it off. And its a battery killer.	1
10791	Good job makes me feel safe even though i have been respecting all rules and doing whats best for everyone thank u	0
10792	No cases linked using the app, what's the point if it's going to kill my battery everyday. I'll re-download it if it's proven to be a help	1
10793	Mobile phone is overheating lately due to this app. I have deleted a significant number of other apps or stopped them. This is the only app which I haven't touched and it is making my mobile phone overheat While I do love the concept of this app. I am nervous of how hot my mobile gets especially when a warning of plug out due to excessive heat I had warnings of CPU being overloaded and each time this app was highlighted to me. I want to use this but cannot. Can these issues be fixed?	1

10799	Brilliant idea to restrict the spread of the virus. Is 15 minutes contact per event too long? The likelihood of virus transfer between passersby in a much shorter time is not insignificant . But then again it would be too intrusive. What we have is the best compromise. Peter Robson	0

10805	Not working on samsung note 8	1
10806	Good	0
10807	Was easy to install. But I have some suggestions. 1. Auto activation in time and day. Example: I work every weekday from 08.00 till 16.00. Auto activate in these times. 2. When I'm at home I'm connected to my home wifi network. When I leave home this network is lost and I go to mobile date. This connection lost gives a notification with requesting to activate the tracing. 3. Choose your own language no Mather what system languege you have. 4. Notification on lock screen and on top of screen.	1
10808	The app is affecting my bluetooth headset audio. Intermittent audio occurred and pausing the app bluetooth does not help. I need to uninstall the app in order to resolve the problem. Please resolve so that i can install again.	1

10827	Y i cant get the OTP?	1
10828	i dont like it becose it requires location and bluetooth on, witch takes battery, but more importantly: makes google track me, and thats no good... i give it 1 becose its only effective if infected people install it and use it witch noone will.its more effective to wear a mask that says "i have covid", no tracking with satelites, no battery wasted!	1
10829	Oh wow, i feel safe.	0
10830	Ok whole process took a few mins, simple , just leave off the leading 0 in your mobile number. Happy to do my bit as a member of the Australian family, keep safe everyone. Please stay positive , show your leadership and support for your family, friends and commmunity.	1

10839	No other language option than Turkish and pointless application , it didnt give me a mask code even though I am a citizen and have never asked for a code before that.	1
10840	Too many permissions, why does it need permissions to my pictures, contacts and Bluetooth, data privacy is being violated. It's better if this app only had access to locations and camera and dialer only....poor app	1

10853	Hi, i did not receive any OTP code for verification. i tried a few times.	1
10854	This latest iteration tells you how many people you have been in contact with. I tested it. Yesterday during my exercise the number of contacts increased by 14. I had walked continuous for 45 minutes, did not need to stop to cross road. I walk behind one person, until I was able to overtake. I did pass several people sitting at bus stops. We were told that contacts would be recorded based on within 2 metres for 1 minute. From my test, it would appear the time element is not working.	1
10855	Absolutely drains my battery on my A7, I can maybe get 1.5 days out of it with little use. But since this went on its flat by about 7pm. Wife has an A5 and it drains hers too.	1
10856	Last upgraded is no good	1
10857	Only works if a person who was diagnosed with C19 passes by. Such people should stay at home, so chance of meeting such person is minimal. Requires keeping your BT on all the time. I rather wear the mask and avoid masses.	0

10876	Very useful and timely app.thanks to the developer of this app.we are already using this.	0
10877	Has been fine until now but have started getting warnings about battery and processor usage by the app in the last 24 hours. It's noticably draining the battery life even after restarting the phone. Will have to uninstall if it doesn't improve which defeats the purpose of the app!	1
10878	Excellent app	0
10879	Good effort. But not enough capacity. Got thus error. Too many request. Please try again later.	1

Please improve public awareness!\n\nin the meantime, please let your friends, family, and colleagues know :)	0

10897	I'm currently using Huawei P40 Pro which does not support Google mobile services. The app isn't available in the Huawei App gallery. So, I downloaded the apk file and installed it but it doesn't work and always gets stuck at the OTP. Please find a way to fix it. P40, P40 pro/pro +, Mate 30, Mate 30 pro and a number of other devices do not support Google services and hence unable to use TraceTogether. We can't just buy a new phone just for the sake of using this app. Kindly look into this.	1

10899	nice apps	0
10900	NIC devs, this app is not getting installed only on my phone lol!! So its fine with me, as I did not wished to share my details to the Emperor of India and his fatso advisor. I know you guys will be coming back to my review with one of your standard reply.. I don't give a fish to that!	1
10901	Although i got an error message saying the otp was wrong, when i clicked 'resend otp' it lets me proceed with the rest of the setup and the app is now working for me. In case u get the same issue, try this trick. App may have setup issues for some of us, but not everyone gets these issues, so try the app for urself. Let's aim to get as many pple on the app as possible so it can keep us all safe & stop covid-19 without shutting down our city.	1
10902	Bluetooth Range. Class 2 (the most common kind) operate up to 10m (33ft), and class 3 are the least powerful and don't go much beyond 1m (3.3ft). Why not use mobile data to monitor the entire city, country or world?	1
10903	Very accurate and easy for us	0
10904	Good n.easy to use	0
10905	The app always closed by itself. If the app is closed by itself and unaware it will not track. Then it will be useless.	1

10917	The app should be installed to at least 80-90% of the population to be effective. A better publicity campaign and easier to understand privacy explanations might be helpful.	0
10918	Nice	0
10919	According to the specs, there should be no reason for this app not to work on my phone - but it doesn’t. The support text online is very minimal, and does not provide sufficiently robust instructions on exactly what settings to check if the app isn’t working as it should. I’ve reset phone, deleted and re-installed app, etc... I then emailed for tech support several days ago and am now waiting for a response of some sort.	1
10920	Imagine trusting this corrupt government to track your phone! Dan Andrews and his pet Sutton belong in jail. But everyone above them are corrupt too. So unless some grows a pair, our corrupt leaders will sell our country to the CCP. Delete this app. Masks don't work against viruses. Experimental RNA vaccines are more dangerous than the virus. The police are all run by Freemasons. Our government is run by corrupt pedophiles. #DanAndrewsForTheHague2021	1

10930	So far so good.......however would agree with other commentators that: a/ Needs a push notification reminder to 'Check in' b/ The percentages needed to be finer and tracked so we can see any changes. Whole figures doesn't show this c/ Maybe a Map facility to show ' Hot spots'	0
10931	Easy to set up, but for some reason the exposure logging is stuck on "active for 13 of the past 14 days" for a few days now. Didn't it log the last few days or what's happening? (Is fixe now) Also it only updates once a day during the early morning, wouldn't multiple updates a day be better for a quick response time?	1
10932	Keeps telling me that my number is invalid	1
